  {"id":"AbbassiEtAl2012","abstract":"The combined impact of rotation and magnetic fields on oscillations of stellar fluids is still not well known theoretically. It mixes Alfvén and inertial waves. Neutron stars are a place where both effects may be at work. We aim to solve this problem in the context of the r-mode instability in neutron stars, as it appears when these modes are coupled to gravitational radiation. We consider a rotating spherical shell filled with a viscous fluid of infinite electrical conductivity and analyse propagation of model perturbations when a dipolar magnetic field is bathing the fluid layer. We perform an extensive numerical analysis and find that the m= 2 r-mode oscillation is influenced by the magnetic field when the Lehnert number (the ratio of Alfvén speed to rotation speed) exceeds a value proportional to the one-fourth power of the Ekman number (a non-dimensional measure of viscosity). This scaling is interpreted as the coincidence of the width of internal shear layers of inertial modes and the wavelength of the Alfvén waves. Applied to the case of rotating magnetic neutron stars, we find that dipolar magnetic fields above 10 14G are necessary to perturb the r-mode instability. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS.","author":[{"family":"Abbassi","given":"S."},{"family":"Rieutord","given":"M."},{"family":"Rezania","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"AbbassiEtAl2012","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19930.x","ISSN":"00358711","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"2893-2899","title":"An r-mode in a magnetic rotating spherical layer: Application to neutron stars","type":"article-journal","volume":"419"},
  {"id":"AbdrabouLu2019","abstract":"Exceptional points (EPs) are special parameter values of a non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem where eigenfunctions corresponding to a multiple eigenvalue coalesce. In optics, EPs are associated with a number of counter-intuitive wave phenomena, and have potential applications in lasing, sensing, mode conversion and spontaneous emission processes. For open photonic structures, resonant states are complex-frequency solutions of the Maxwell’s equations with outgoing radiation conditions. For open dielectric structures without material gain or loss, the eigenvalue problem for resonant states can have EPs, since it is non-Hermitian due to radiation losses. For applications in nanophotonics, it is important to understand EPs for resonant states on small finite dielectric structures consisting of conventional dielectric materials. To achieve this objective, we study EPs of resonant states on finite sets of parallel infinitely-long circular dielectric cylinders with subwavelength radii. For systems with two, three and four cylinders, we develop an efficient numerical method for computing EPs, present examples for second and third order EPs, and highlight their topological features. Our work provides insight to understanding EPs on more complicated photonic structures, and can be used as a simple platform to explore applications of EPs.","author":[{"family":"Abdrabou","given":"Amgad"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Ya Yan"}],"citation-key":"AbdrabouLu2019","container-title":"arXiv","DOI":"10.1364/josab.36.001659","ISSN":"23318422","issue":"May","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"title":"Exceptional points for resonant states on parallel circular dielectric cylinders","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Aerts2021","abstract":"Yearslong time series of high-precision brightness measurements have been assembled for thousands of years with telescopes operating in space. Such data have allowed astronomers to measure the physics of stellar interiors via nonradial oscillations, opening a new avenue to study the stars in the Universe. Asteroseismology, the interpretation of the characteristics of oscillation modes in terms of the physical properties of the stellar interior, brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate and how they build up their chemistry throughout their evolution. Data-driven space asteroseismology has delivered a drastic increase in the reliability of computer models mimicking the evolution of stars born with a variety of masses and metallicities. Such models are critical ingredients for modern physics as a whole because they are used throughout various contemporary and multidisciplinary research fields in space science, including the search for life outside the Solar System, archaeological studies of the Milky Way, and the study of single and binary supernova progenitors, among which are future gravitational wave sources. The specific role and potential of asteroseismology for those modern research fields are illustrated. The review concludes with current limitations of asteroseismology and highlights how they can be overcome with ongoing and future large infrastructures for survey astronomy combined with new theoretical research in the era of high-performance computing. This review presents results obtained through major community efforts over the past decade. These breakthroughs were achieved in a collaborative and inclusive spirit that is characteristic of the asteroseismology community. The review's aim is to make this research field accessible to graduate students and readers coming from other fields of physics, with incentives to enjoy and join future applications in this domain of astrophysics.","author":[{"family":"Aerts","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"Aerts2021","container-title":"Reviews of Modern Physics","DOI":"10.1103/RevModPhys.93.015001","ISSN":"15390756","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"Probing the interior physics of stars through asteroseismology","type":"article-journal","volume":"93"},

These hydrodynamical waves which only exist because of the Earth's rotation, must be in the Earth's fluid outer core. Close proximity of the observed periods to those predicted for a homogeneous fluid suggests the waves should be labelled inertial because buoyancy and compressibility effects must be small or self-cancelling. Some of the identified waves have azimuthal wavenumber one, consistent with their occurrence after large, deep earthquakes which probably excite the waves through a small perturbation in the Earth's rotation. Other waves are axially symmetric, consistent with a small change in the magnitude of the fluid core's rotation rate. All the waves decay more rapidly than would be expected for Ekman dissipation which suggests an additional dynamical damping associated with mantle-inner core coupling.

  {"id":"AltermanEtAl1959","abstract":"A study is made of the free and forced oscillations of the earth. The natural periods are determined for radial, torsional and spheroidal types of oscillation. Several models of the earth are used: a homogeneous model, such as was assumed originally by Love, a model con­sisting of a homogeneous solid mantle enclosing a homogeneous liquid core, Bullen’s model B, and Bullard’s models I and II. It is found that the spheroidal oscillation of order 2 has a period of about 53·5 min in all models, except the homogeneous one, for which this period is only 44·3 min. The common period of 53·5 min agrees to within the observational error with the period of 57 min observed by Benioff on the seismograms of the Kamchatka earthquake of 1952. In contrast to all the other models, Bullen’s model B possesses an additional spheroidal oscillation of order 2 of a period of 101 min. The latter oscillation is confined mainly to the core, its amplitude in the mantle being relatively very small. Benioff’s observation of a second oscillation of a 100 min period in the Kamchatka earthquake record might be considered as evidence favouring Bullen’s model B. The latter differs from Bullard’s models mainly by having a central density of around 18 instead of about 12 g/cm\n              3\n              . However, a theoretical investigation of the relative excitation of the various free modes by an impulsive compressional point-source situated at a shallow focal depth, shows that the amplitude of the 100 min oscillation should be more than 1000 times weaker than that of the 53·5 min oscillation. It is thus not clear how a near-surface earthquake could have excited the core­-oscillation. The spectrum of the free modes of oscillation has also been determined for\n              n\n              = 3 and 4, including the fundamental and the first two overtones for each case. The computed free periods of spheroidal oscillation range from 53·5 min down to a period of 8 min for the fourth overtone in the case\n              n\n              = 2. We have also treated the bodily tides for Bullen’s and Bullard’s models. Love’s numbers were determined in the case\n              n\n              = 2 for tidal periods of 6, 6√2, 12 h and ∞. The dependence of the Love numbers on the period is small, a maximum range of variation of 13% occurring in the\n              k\n              -values between the periods of 6 h and ∞.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Alterman","given":"Z."},{"family":"Jarosch","given":"H."},{"family":"Pekeris","given":"C.

Firstly, we differentiate displacements due to diurnal solid tides to obtain extension along any azimuthal direction in terms of three complex parameters (A, S, C) which depend on latitude and frequency. Then, we demonstrate that we can invert the FCN complex frequency and the sensitivity of Im(A) and Re(S) to the resonance from our data.

The results highlight issues with the traditional approach to the problem, leading us to rethink the computational strategy for the r-modes of nonbarotropic neutron stars. We outline two strategies for dealing with the problem. For moderate to slowly rotating neutron stars the only viable alternative may be to approach the problem numerically from the outset, while a meaningful slow-rotation calculation can be carried out for the fastest known spinning stars (which may be close to being driven unstable by the emission of gravitational waves). We demonstrate that the latter approach leads to a problem close, but not identical, to that for barotropic inertial modes.

  {"id":"AnufrievEtAl2005","abstract":"Convection in the Earth's core is usually studied in the Boussinesq approximation in which the compressibility of the liquid is ignored. The density of the Earth's core varies from ICB to CMB by approximately 20%. The question of whether we need to take this variation into account in core convection and dynamo models is examined. We show that it is in the thermodynamic equations that differences between compressible and Boussinesq models become most apparent. The heat flux conducted down the adiabat is much smaller near the inner core boundary than it is near the core-mantle boundary. In consequence, the heat flux carried by convection is much larger nearer the inner core boundary than it is near the core-mantle boundary. This effect will have an important influence on dynamo models. Boussinesq models also assume implicitly that the rate of working of the gravitational and buoyancy forces, as well as the Ohmic and viscous dissipation, are small compared to the heat flux through the core. These terms are not negligible in the Earth's core heat budget, and neglecting them makes it difficult to get a thermodynamically consistent picture of core convection. We show that the usual anelastic equations simplify considerably if the anelastic liquid approximation, valid if α T ≪ 1, where α is the coefficient of expansion and T a typical core temperature, is used. The resulting set of equations are not significantly more difficult to solve numerically than the usual Boussinesq equations. The relationship of our anelastic liquid equations to the Boussinesq equations is also examined. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","author":[{"family":"Anufriev","given":"A.

  {"id":"Aubert2019","abstract":"Geomagnetic jerks are abrupt changes in the second time derivative—the secular acceleration—of Earth’s magnetic field that punctuate ground observatory records. As their dynamical origin has not yet been established, they represent a major obstacle to the prediction of geomagnetic field behaviour for years to decades ahead. Recent jerks have been linked to short-lived, temporally alternating and equatorially localized pulses of secular acceleration observed in satellite data, associated with rapidly alternating flows at Earth’s core surface. Here we show that these signatures can be reproduced in numerical simulations of the geodynamo that realistically account for the interaction between slow core convection and rapid hydromagnetic waves. In these simulations, jerks are caused by the arrival of localized Alfvén wave packets radiated from sudden buoyancy releases inside the core. As they reach the core surface, the waves focus their energy towards the equatorial plane and along lines of strong magnetic flux, creating sharp interannual changes in core flow and producing geomagnetic jerks through the induced variations in magnetic field acceleration. The ability to numerically reproduce jerks offers a new way to probe the physical properties of Earth’s deep interior.","author":[{"family":"Aubert","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Finlay","given":"Christopher C."}],"citation-key":"Aubert2019","container-title":"Nature Geoscience","DOI":"10.1038/s41561-019-0355-1","ISSN":"17520908","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"393-398","title":"Geomagnetic jerks and rapid hydromagnetic waves focusing at Earth’s core surface","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-019-0355-1","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"AubertDumberry2011","abstract":"We present a systematic survey of numerical geodynamo simulations where the inner core is allowed to differentially rotate in the longitudinal direction with respect to the mantle. We focus on the long-term behaviour of inner core rotation, on timescales much longer than the overturn time of the ﬂuid outer core, including the steady component of rotation. The inner core is subject to viscous and magnetic torques exerted by the ﬂuid outer core, and a gravitational restoring torque exerted by the mantle. We show that the rate of steady inner core rotation is limited by the differential rotation between spherical surfaces that the convective dynamics can sustain across the ﬂuid outer core. We further show that this differential rotation is determined by a torque balance between the resistive Lorentz force and the Coriolis force on spherical surfaces within the ﬂuid core. We derive a scaling law on the basis of this equilibrium suggesting that the ratio of the steady inner core rotation to typical angular velocity within the ﬂuid core should be proportional to the square root of the Ekman number, in agreement with our numerical results. The addition of gravitational coupling does not alter this scaling, though it further reduces the amplitude of inner core rotation. In contrast, the long-term ﬂuctuations in inner core rotation remain proportional to the ﬂuid core angular velocity, with no apparent dependency on the Ekman number. If the same torque balance pertains to the Earth’s core conditions, the inner core rotation then consists in a very slow super rotation of a few degrees per million years, superimposed over large ﬂuctuations (at about a tenth of a degree per year). This suggests that the present-day seismically inferred inner core rotation is a fragment of a time-varying signal, rather than a steady super rotation. For the inner core rotation ﬂuctuations not to cause excessive variations in the length-of-day, the strength of the gravitational coupling between the inner core and the mantle must be smaller than previously published values. We ﬁnally explore how the torque balance which we observe in our models could be altered in planetary cores, yielding possibly larger values of the steady rotation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Aubert","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"AubertDumberry2011","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04842.x","ISSN":"0956540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1]]},"language":"en","page":"162-170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Steady and fluctuating inner core rotation in numerical geodynamo models: Steady and fluctuating inner core rotation","title-short":"Steady and fluctuating inner core rotation in numerical geodynamo models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04842.x","volume":"184"},
  {"id":"AubertEtAl2017","abstract":"Self-sustained convective dynamos in planetary systems operate in an asymptotic regime of rapid rotation, where a balance is thought to hold between the Coriolis, pressure, buoyancy and Lorentz forces (the MAC balance). Classical numerical solutions have previously been obtained in a regime of moderate rotation where viscous and inertial forces are still signiﬁcant. We deﬁne a uni-dimensional path in parameter space between classical models and asymptotic conditions from the requirements to enforce a MAC balance and to preserve the ratio between the magnetic diffusion and convective overturn times (the magnetic Reynolds number). Direct numerical simulations performed along this path show that the spatial structure of the solution at scales larger than the magnetic dissipation length is largely invariant. This enables the deﬁnition of large-eddy simulations resting on the assumption that small-scale details of the hydrodynamic turbulence are irrelevant to the determination of the large-scale asymptotic state. These simulations are shown to be in good agreement with direct simulations in the range where both are feasible, and can be computed for control parameter values far beyond the current state of the art, such as an Ekman number E = 10−8. We obtain strong-ﬁeld convective dynamos approaching the MAC balance and a Taylor state to an unprecedented degree of accuracy. The physical connection between classical models and asymptotic conditions is shown to be devoid of abrupt transitions, demonstrating the asymptotic relevance of classical numerical dynamo mechanisms.

  {"id":"AubertGillet2021","abstract":"Ground observatory and satellite-based determinations of temporal variations in the geomagnetic ﬁeld probe a decadal to annual time scale range where Earth’s core slow, inertialess convective motions and rapidly propagating, inertia-bearing hydromagnetic waves are in interplay. Here we numerically model and jointly investigate these two important features with the help of a geodynamo simulation that (to date) is the closest to the dynamical regime of Earth’s core. This model also considerably enlarges the scope of a previous asymptotic scaling analysis, which in turn strengthens the relevance of the approach to describe Earth’s core dynamics. Three classes of hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic waves are identiﬁed in the model output, all with propagation velocity largely exceeding that of convective advection: axisymmetric, geostrophic Alfve´n torsional waves, and non-axisymmetric, quasigeostrophic Alfve´n and Rossby waves. The contribution of these waves to the geomagnetic acceleration amounts to an enrichment and ﬂattening of its energy density spectral proﬁle at decadal time scales, thereby providing a constraint on the extent of the f −4 range observed in the geomagnetic frequency power spectrum. As the model approaches Earth’s core conditions, this spectral broadening arises because the decreasing inertia allows for waves at increasing frequencies. Through non-linear energy transfers with convection underlain by Lorentz stresses, these waves also extract an increasing amount of energy from the underlying convection as their key time scale decreases towards a realistic value. The ﬂow and magnetic acceleration energies carried by waves both linearly increase with the ratio of the magnetic diﬀusion time scale to the Alfve´n time scale, highlighting the dominance of Alfve´n waves in the signal and the stabilising control of magnetic dissipation at non-axisymmetric scales. Extrapolation of the results to Earth’s core conditions supports the detectability of Alfve´n waves in geomagnetic observations, either as axisymmetric torsional oscillations or through the geomagnetic jerks caused by non-axisymmetric waves. In contrast, Rossby waves appear to be too fast and carry too little magnetic energy to be detectable in geomagnetic acceleration signals of limited spatio-temporal resolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Aubert","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Gillet","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"AubertGillet2021","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggab054","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,26]]},"language":"en","page":"1854-1873","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The interplay of fast waves and slow convection in geodynamo simulations nearing Earth's core conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06552","volume":"225"},

These modulations occur over roughly 90 year timescales for outer core flow rates of 1°/year. When the electromagnetic torques are only marginally stronger than the gravitational torques, the inner core slowly rotates prograde by 90°relative to the mantle, escaping a gravitational well in roughly 100 years, then falls into the next gravitational well, rotating through 90°in just 4 years. Finite inner core viscosity is modeled using a relaxation time for the inner core topography. With relaxation, the gravitational torque reduces but does not eliminate the anomalous inner core rotation.

The problem is solved in the time domain and the flow in the ocean is calculated simultaneously with the deformation of the core and the ice shell. To simplify the calculations, we assume that the internal density interfaces are spherical and the effective viscosity of water is equal to or greater than 100 Pa s. The method is used to study the effect of an unconsolidated core on tidal dissipation in Enceladus' ocean. We show that the partitioning of tidal heating between the core and the ocean strongly depends on the thickness of the ocean layer. If the ocean thickness is significantly greater than 1 km, heat production is dominated by tidal dissipation in the core and the amount of heat produced in the ocean is negligible. In contrast, when the ocean thickness is less than about 1 km, tidal heating in the core diminishes and dissipation in the ocean increases, leaving the total heat production unchanged. Extrapolation of our results to realistic conditions indicates that tidal flow is turbulent which suggests that the linearized Navier-Stokes equation may not be appropriate for modeling the tidal response of icy moons. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained by solving the Laplace tidal equations and discuss the limitations of the two-dimensional models of ocean circulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Aygün","given":"Burak"},{"family":"Čadek","given":"Ondřej"}],"citation-key":"AygunCadek2023","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","DOI":"10.1029/2023JE007907","ISSN":"2169-9100","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.","page":"e2023JE007907","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Impact of the Core Deformation on the Tidal Heating and Flow in Enceladus' Subsurface Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JE007907","volume":"128"},

  {"id":"Backus1986","abstract":"The theory of surface operators is described and applied to four surface operators on spheres: the dimensionless surface gradient, ▽1=r▽-r∂r; the dimensionless surface curl, Λ1=rˆ×▽1 ; the dimensionless surface Laplacian, ▽1²=▽1 · ▽1; and the Funk-Hecke operators, integral operators with axisymmetric kernels. Three methods are given for solving ▽1²g=f as g=▽1−2f; one method works numerically when f has a rapidly convergent expansion in spherical harmonics, the second works when f is smooth in longitude but not latitude, and the third (a Funk-Hecke operation) works when f is rough in all directions. With this apparatus, a complete proof is given of the Helmholtz representation of an arbitrary vector field v S (r), the spherical surface of radius r centered on the origin: there are unique scalar fields f, g, h on S(r) such that v=rˆf+▽1g+Λ1h and 〈g〉r=〈h〉r=0. Here 〈g〉r is the average value of g on S (r). From the Helmholtz representation on spherical surfaces, the Mie or poloidal-toroidal representation in spherical shells is deduced. Suppose S(a,c) is the spherical shell whose inner and outer boundaries are S(a) and S(c). Suppose B is solenoidal in S (a,c), i.e., ▽·B=0 and 〈Br〉a=0. Then there are unique scalar fields P and Q in S(a,c) such that B=▽ × Λ1P + Λ1Q and 〈P〉r=〈Q〉r=0 for a ⪕ r ⪕ c. The fields P = ▽ × Λ1P and Q=Λ1Q are the poloidal and toroidal parts of B. Applications of this formalism to geomagnetic field modeling are discussed. Gauss's resolution of the geomagnetic field B on S(b) into internal and external parts is generalized; if the radial current Jr does not vanish on S (b), then to Gauss's expression must be added a toroidal field on S(b) due entirely to Jr on S(b). A simple proof is given of Runcorn's theorem that to first order in susceptibility no external magnetic field results from magnetization in a horizontally homogeneous spherical shell polarized by sources inside the shell. A Funk-Hecke-based method of modeling ionospheric currents is described, which may be more accurate than truncated spherical harmonic expansions and easier to use than Biot-Savart integrals. Finally, the formalism makes possible the modeling of satellite samples of the geomagnetic field in a spherical shell S (a,c) where electric currents cannot be neglected. Two approximation schemes are described. One is a truncated power series expansion in (c-a)/H, where H is the radial length scale of the currents. The other assumes that most of B in S(a,c) is not due to the currents between S (a) and S(c), and that the currents in S(a,c) are field-aligned. Then the collection of physically possible magnetic fields in S(a,c) is only 50% larger, in a well-defined sense, than the collection of vacuum fields there.

While Tyler (Tyler, R.H. [2009]. Geophys. Res. Lett. 36(15), L15205; Tyler, R.H. [2011]. Icarus 211(1), 770-779) has suggested that the geological activity and the large heat flow of Enceladus could result from tidal heating triggered by a large obliquity of at least 0.05-0.1°, theoretical models of the Cassini state predict the obliquity to be two to three orders of magnitude smaller for an entirely solid and rigid Enceladus. We investigate the influence of an internal subsurface ocean and of tidal deformations of the solid layers on the obliquity of Enceladus. Our Cassini state model takes into account the external torque exerted by Saturn on each layer of the satellite and the internal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of the liquid layer. As a new feature, our model also includes additional torques that arise because of the periodic tides experienced by the satellite. We find that the upper limit for the obliquity of a solid Enceladus is 4.5×10-4degrees and is negligibly affected by elastic deformations. The presence of an internal ocean decreases this upper limit by 13.1%, elasticity attenuating this decrease by only 0.5%. For larger satellites, such as Titan, elastic effects could be more significant because of their larger tidal deformations. As a consequence, it appears that it is easier to reconcile the theoretical estimates of Titan's obliquity with the measured obliquity than reported in previous studies wherein the solid layers or the entire satellite were assumed to be rigid. Since the obliquity of Enceladus cannot reach Tyler's requirement, obliquity tides are unlikely to be the source of the large heat flow of Enceladus. More likely, the geological activity at Enceladus' south pole results from eccentricity tides. Even in the most favorable case, the upper limit for the obliquity of Enceladus corresponds to about two meters at most at the surface of Enceladus. This is well below the resolution of Cassini images.

  {"id":"BalandEtAl2012","abstract":"The obliquity of the Galilean satellites is small but not yet observed. Studies of cycloidal lineaments and strike-slip fault patterns on Europa suggest that Europa’s obliquity is about 1°, although theoretical models of the obliquity predict the obliquity to be one order of magnitude smaller for an entirely solid Europa. Here, we investigate the influence of a global liquid layer on the obliquity of the Galilean satellites. Io most likely has a fully liquid core, while Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are thought to have an internal global liquid water ocean beneath an external ice shell. We use a model for the obliquity based on a Cassini state model extended to the presence of an internal liquid layer and the internal gravitational and pressure torques induced by the presence of this layer. We find that the obliquity of Io only weakly depends on the different internal structure models considered, because of the weak influence of the liquid core which is therefore almost impossible to detect through observations of the obliquity. The obliquity of Europa is almost constant in time and its mean value is smaller (0.033–0.044°) with an ocean than without (0.055°). An accuracy of 0.004° (about 100m on the spin pole location at the surface) would allow detecting the internal ocean. The obliquity of Ganymede and Callisto depends more on their interior structure because of the possibility of resonant amplifications for some periodic terms of the solution. Their ocean may be easily detected if, at the measuring time, the actual internal structure model lead to a very different value of the obliquity than in the solid case. A long-term monitoring of their shell obliquity would be more helpful to infer information on the shell thickness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Baland","given":"Rose-Marie"},{"family":"Yseboodt","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Hoolst","given":"Tim Van"}],"citation-key":"BalandEtAl2012","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2012.05.020","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8,1]]},"page":"435-448","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Obliquity of the Galilean satellites: The influence of a global internal liquid layer","title-short":"Obliquity of the Galilean satellites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103512002023","volume":"220"},
  {"id":"BalandEtAl2014","abstract":"Several quantities measured by the Cassini-Huygens mission provide insight into the interior of Titan: the second-degree gravity field coefficients, the shape, the tidal Love number, the electric field, and the orientation of its rotation axis. The measured obliquity and tides, as well as the electric field, are evidence for the presence of an internal global ocean beneath the icy shell of Titan. Here we use these different observations together to constrain the density profile assuming a four-layer interior model (ice I shell, liquid water ocean, high pressure ice mantle, and rock core). Even though the observed second degree gravity field is consistent with the hydrostatic relation J2=10C22/3, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a synchronous satellite to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, the observed shape of the surface as well as the non-zero degree-three gravity signal indicate some departure from hydrostaticity. Therefore, we do not restrain our range of assumed density profiles to those corresponding to the hydrostatic value of the moment of inertia (0.34). From a range of density profiles consistent with the radius and mass of the satellite, we compute the obliquity of the Cassini state and the tidal Love number k2. The obliquity is computed from a Cassini state model for a satellite with an internal liquid layer, each layer having an ellipsoidal shape consistent with the measured surface shape and gravity field. The observed (nearly hydrostatic) gravity field is obtained by an additional deflection of the ocean–ice I shell interface, assuming that the layers have uniform densities. We show that the measured obliquity can be reproduced only for internal models with a dense ocean (between 1275 and 1350kgm−3) above a differentiated interior with a full separation of rock and ice. We obtain normalized moments of inertia between 0.31 and 0.33, significantly lower than the expected hydrostatic value (0.34). Evolutionary mechanisms leading to a significant departure from hydrostatic equilibrium while J2=10C22/3 remain an open issue. The tidal Love number is found to be mostly sensitive to the ocean density and to a lesser extent to the ice shell thickness. By combining obliquity and tidal Love number constraints, we show that the thickness of the outer ice shell is at least 40km and the ocean thickness is less than 100km, with an averaged density of 1300–1350kgm−3. The elevated density (>3400kgm−3) found for the rocky core further suggests that it might possess a significant fraction of iron.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Baland","given":"Rose-Marie"},{"family":"Tobie","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Lefèvre","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"BalandEtAl2014","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2014.04.007","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,15]]},"page":"29-41","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Titan’s internal structure inferred from its gravity field, shape, and rotation state","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514001997","volume":"237"},
  {"id":"BalandEtAl2019","abstract":"We here develop, in an angular momentum approach, a consistent model that integrates all rotation variables and considers forcing both by the central planet and a potential atmosphere. Existing angular momentum approaches for studying the polar motion, precession, and libration of synchronously rotating satellites, with or without an internal global ﬂuid layer (e.g., a subsurface ocean) usually focus on one aspect of rotation and neglect coupling with the other rotation phenomena. The model variables chosen correspond most naturally with the free modes, although they differ from those of Earth rotation studies, and facilitate a comparison with existing decoupled rotation models that break the link between the rotation motions. The decoupled models perform well in reproducing the free modes, except for the Free Ocean Nutation in the decoupled polar motion model. We also demonstrate the high accuracy of the analytical forced solutions of decoupled models, which are easier to use to interpret observations from past and future space missions. We show that the effective decoupling between the polar motion and precession implies that the spin precession and its associated mean obliquity are mainly governed by the external gravitational torque by the parent planet, whereas the polar motion of the solid layers is mainly governed by the angular momentum exchanges between the atmosphere (e.g., for Titan) and the surface. To put into perspective the difference between rotation models for a synchronously rotating icy moon with a thin ice shell and classical Earth rotation models, we also consider the case of the Moon, which has a thick outer layer above a liquid core.

The contribution to the nutations due to the liquid core and tidal deformations will be detected, allowing to constrain the interior of Mars. To avoid introducing systematic errors in the determination of the core properties, an accurate precession and nutation model for a rigidly behaving Mars is needed. Here, we develop such a model with adequate accuracy based on the Torque approach and compare it to previous models. We include in the model the forcings by the Sun, Phobos, Deimos, and the other planets of the solar system. We also include the geodetic precession and nutations. We use semi-analytical developments for the solar and planetary torques, and analytical solutions for the effect of Phobos and Deimos and for the geodetic precession and nutations. With a truncation criterion of 0.025 milliarcseconds in prograde and/or retrograde amplitude, we identify 43 nutation terms.

  {"id":"BalandVanHoolst2010","abstract":"The four Galilean satellites are thought to harbor one or even two global internal liquid layers beneath their surface layer. The iron core of Io and Ganymede is most likely (partially) liquid and also the core of Europa may be liquid. Furthermore, there are strong indications for the existence of a subsurface ocean in Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Here, we investigate whether libration observations can be used to prove the existence of these liquid layers and to constrain the thickness of the overlying solid layers. For Io, the presence of a small liquid core increases the libration of the mantle by a few percent with respect to an entirely solid Io and mantle libration observations could be used to determine the mantle thickness with a precision of several tens of kilometers given that the libration amplitude can be measured with a precision of 1. m. For Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, the presence of a water ocean close to the surface increases by at least an order of magnitude the ice shell libration amplitude with respect to an entirely solid satellite. The shell libration depends essentially on the shell thickness and to a minor extent on the density difference between the ocean and the ice shell. The possible presence of a liquid core inside Europa and Ganymede has no noticeable influence on their shell libration. For a precision of several meters on the libration measurements, in agreement with the expected accuracy with the NASA/ESA EJSM orbiter mission to Europa and Ganymede, an error on the shell thickness of a few tens kilometers is expected.

These waves have the obscure property that their crests always progress eastwards—but, for a certain subset, energy can nevertheless be transmitted westwards. In fact, this subset corresponds to sheet-like flow structures, extended in both the axial and radial directions, which are likely to be preferentially excited by convective upwellings in the Earth’s rapidly rotating outer core. To enable their analysis, the quasi-geostrophic (QG) approximation is employed, which assumes horizontal motions to be independent of distance along the rotation axis, yet accounts for variations in the container height (i.e. the slope of the core–mantle boundary). By projecting the momentum equation onto flows of a QG form, a general equation governing their evolution is derived, which is then adapted for the treatment of two initial value problems—in both Cartesian and spherical geometries—which demonstrate the preference for westward energy propagation by the waves in question. The merits of this mechanism as an explanation for westward drift are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Bardsley","given":"O.

  {"id":"Bardsley2019","abstract":"This thesis addresses the generation and propagation of waves in Earth’s fluid outer core, with the objective of better understanding their role in maintaining our planet’s magnetic field. The classes of waves studied, which owe their existence both to the rapid rotation of the Earth about its axis and the vibration of magnetic field lines, are united by the fact they are dispersive — which is to say, the velocity at which a given wave travels is a function of the spacing and orientation of its wave crests; the behaviour of such waves is remarkably rich and has frequently counter-intuitive consequences. Our analysis begins at the very smallest scales of the convection which stirs the liquid iron outer core, asking how localised features – such as turbulent eddies or buoyant parcels – might incite oscillatory motions at this fundamental scale. Of particular interest are the mechanisms by which columnar flow structures are established and sustained. We show that, in a situation where the wave source is threaded by a large-scale magnetic field, these processes are managed by a previously-overlooked denomination of oscillations dubbed inertial-Alfvén waves. These objects establish the starting point for an investigation into the journeys embarked upon by packets of waves throughout the outer core, following their progress as global- scale variations in the magnetic field force them to evolve both their spatial structure and propagation velocity. A growing ambient field slows them considerably, even to the point where certain rays are arrested completely and quenched by electromagnetic losses. It is seen that the whole spectrum of small-scale waves influenced by rotation and mean magnetic field have a part to play in this story. Finally, we study a rather distinct variety of waves: hydrodynamic quasi-geostrophic Rossby waves, which rely upon the rapid background rotation and the slope of the core- mantle boundary for their existence. Our interest in these waves is as a possible explanation for the westward drift of the non-dipolar part of the observable magnetic field. As it happens, the crests of these waves invariably progress eastward; however, for a certain subset – corre- sponding to radially-extended sheet-like flows compatible with the convective driving – they can nevertheless convey energy to the west. This insight raises an intriguing new possibility in the mission to solve this centuries-old puzzle.","author":[{"family":"Bardsley","given":"Oliver P"}],"citation-key":"Bardsley2019","issue":"February","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"229","publisher":"University of Cambridge","title":"Dispersive waves in Earth's outer core","type":"thesis"},

We concentrate on the case where the outer boundary rotates fast enough for the Coriolis force to play an important role in the force balance, and the inner boundary rotates slower or in the opposite direction as compared to the outer boundary. As the magnitude of differential rotation is increased, the system is found to transition through three distinct hydrodynamic regimes. The first regime consists of the emergence of the first non-axisymmetric instability. Thereafter one finds the onset of 'fast' equatorially antisymmetric inertial modes, with pairs of inertial modes forming triadic resonances with the first instability. A further increase in the magnitude of differential rotation leads to the flow transitioning to turbulence. Using an artificial excitation, we study how the background flow modifies the inertial mode frequency and structure, thereby causing departures from the eigenmodes of a full sphere and a spherical shell.

A complete understanding of the magnetohydrodynamics requires understanding of the linear problem—when convection onsets in these systems. This is a fluid dynamics problem that has been studied since the early 1900s. Theoretical scaling laws exist for the variation of critical quantities—the Rayleigh number Rac, the azimuthal wavenumber mc, and the angular drift frequency ωc—with respect to the Ekman number E. However, their variation with the radius ratio χ of the spherical shell is still poorly studied. To address this, we use an open source eigenvalue code Kore to compute these critical quantities over an extensive range of parameters spanning four decades in Ekman number and a dense grid of radius ratio from very thick to very thin shells, focusing on no-slip and fixed temperature boundary conditions. We find that these variations are explained well by the theoretical scaling laws, especially at low E, but variations in radius ratio also exist. We obtain scaling laws of boundary layer thicknesses and spatial extent of onset modes with respect to the Ekman number which differ only slightly from theoretical scalings. We show that our data set can be used to obtain good estimates of critical quantities in the moderate E range, where the vast majority of current geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics simulations are performed, yet where asymptotic theory is only moderately accurate.

This activity suggests that tidal dissipation has become spatially localized, perhaps due to a compositional, rheological, and/or thermal anomaly in its ice shell. Here we examine the role that solid-state convection may have played in Enceladus' prolific activity by creating a suitable rheological and thermal anomaly. We find convection can only initiate in the pure water ice I shell of a differentiated Enceladus if the ice grain size is less than 0.3 mm, which is quite small, but may be realistic if non-water-ice impurities (and/or tidal stresses) keep grains from growing. This grain-size restriction becomes more severe for lower basal ice temperatures, which implies that any ammonia present has not become strongly concentrated in a thin basal ocean (while convection occurs). For a maximally thick pure ice shell and underlying ocean, convective heat flows are ∼7–11 mW m−2 for ice grain sizes of 0.1–0.3 mm, compared with the ∼100 mW m−2 measured for Enceladus' south polar terrain from Cassini CIRS observations. Thus whereas solid-state convection may be a prerequisite for Enceladus' geological activity, the observed heat flow requires strong tidal dissipation within the convecting region, and possibly, that convection reaches the surface.","author":[{"family":"Barr","given":"Amy C."},{"family":"McKinnon","given":"William B."}],"citation-key":"Barr2007","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/2006GL028799","ISSN":"00948276","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"2-7","title":"Convection in Enceladus' ice shell: Conditions for initiation","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},

Two kinds of inertial modes therefore exist, depending on whether the hyperbolic domain where characteristics propagate covers the whole shell or not. The occurrence of these two kinds of inertial modes is examined, and we show that the range of frequencies at which inertial waves may propagate is broader than with solid-body rotation. Using high-resolution calculations based on a spectral method, we show that, as with solid-body rotation, singular modes with thin shear layers following short-period attractors still exist with differential rotation. They exist even in the case of a full sphere. In the limit of vanishing viscosities, the width of the shear layers seems to weakly depend on the global background shear, showing a scaling in E^{1/3} with the Ekman number E, as in the solid-body rotation case. There also exist modes with thin detached layers of width scaling with E^{1/2} as Ekman boundary layers. The behavior of inertial waves with a corotation resonance within the shell is also considered. For cylindrical rotation, waves get dramatically absorbed at corotation.

  {"id":"Behounkova2017","abstract":"Abstract We investigated the effect of variations in ice shell thickness and of the tiger stripe fractures crossing Enceladus' south polar terrain on the moon's tidal deformation by performing finite element calculations in three-dimensional geometry. The combination of thinning in the polar region and the presence of faults has a synergistic effect that leads to an increase of both the displacement and stress in the south polar terrain by an order of magnitude compared to that of the traditional model with a uniform shell thickness and without faults. Assuming a simplified conductive heat transfer and neglecting the heat sources below the ice shell, we computed the global heat budget of the ice shell. For the inelastic properties of the shell described by a Maxwell viscoelastic model, we show that unrealistically low average viscosity of the order of 1013 Pa s is necessary for preserving the volume of the ocean, suggesting the important role of the heat sources in the deep interior. Similarly, low viscosity is required to predict the observed delay of the plume activity, which hints at other delaying mechanisms than just the viscoelasticity of the ice shell. The presence of faults results in large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of geysering activity compared to the traditional models without faults. Our model contributes to understanding the physical mechanisms that control the fault activity, and it provides potentially useful information for future missions that will sample the plume for evidence of life.

  {"id":"BekkiEtAl2022","abstract":"Methods. We numerically solved for the eigenmodes of a rotating compressible fluid inside a spherical shell. The model takes into account the solar stratification, turbulent diffusivities, differential rotation (determined by helioseismology), and the latitudinal entropy gradient. As a starting point, we restricted ourselves to a superadiabaticity and turbulent diffusivities that are uniform in space. We identified modes in the inertial frequency range, including the columnar convective modes as well as modes of a mixed character. The corresponding mode dispersion relations and eigenfunctions are computed for azimuthal orders of m ≤ 16.\nResults. The three main results are as follows. Firstly, we find that, for m ≳ 5, the radial dependence of the equatorial Rossby modes with no radial node (n = 0) is radically changed from the traditional expectation (rm) for turbulent diffusivities ≳ 1012 cm2 s−1. Secondly, we find mixed modes, namely, modes that share properties of the equatorial Rossby modes with one radial node (n = 1) and the columnar convective modes, which are not substantially affected by turbulent diffusion. Thirdly, we show that the m = 1 high-latitude mode in the model is consistent with the solar observations when the latitudinal entropy gradient corresponding to a thermal wind balance is included (baroclinically unstable mode).\nConclusions. To our knowledge, this work is the first realistic eigenvalue calculation of the global modes of the rotating solar convection zone. This calculation reveals a rich spectrum of modes in the inertial frequency range, which can be directly compared to the observations. In turn, the observed modes can inform us about the solar convection zone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bekki","given":"Y."},{"family":"Cameron","given":"R.H."},{"family":"Gizon","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"BekkiEtAl2022","container-title":"Astronomy & Astrophysics","container-title-short":"A&A","DOI":"10.1051/0004-6361/202243164","ISSN":"0004-6361, 1432-0746","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,12]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Theory of solar oscillations in the inertial frequency range: Linear modes of the convection zone","title-short":"Theory of solar oscillations in the inertial frequency range","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202243164"},

  {"id":"Beuthe2013","abstract":"In a body periodically strained by tides, heating produced by viscous friction is far from homogeneous. The spatial distribution of tidal heating depends in a complicated way on the tidal potential and on the internal structure of the body. I show here that the distribution of the dissipated power within a spherically stratified body is a linear combination of three angular functions. These angular functions depend only on the tidal potential whereas the radial weights are specified by the internal structure of the body. The 3D problem of predicting spatial patterns of dissipation at all radii is thus reduced to the 1D problem of computing weight functions. I compute spatial patterns in various toy models without assuming a specific rheology: a viscoelastic thin shell stratified in conductive and convective layers, an incompressible homogeneous body and a two-layer model of uniform density with a liquid or rigid core. For a body in synchronous rotation undergoing eccentricity tides, dissipation in a mantle surrounding a liquid core is highest at the poles. Within a soft layer (or asthenosphere) in contact with a more rigid layer, the same tides generate maximum heating in the equatorial region with a significant degree-four structure if the soft layer is thin. The asthenosphere can be a layer of partial melting in the upper mantle or, very differently, an icy layer in contact with a silicate mantle or solid core. Tidal heating patterns are thus of three main types: mantle dissipation (with the icy shell above an ocean as a particular case), dissipation in a thin soft layer and dissipation in a thick soft layer. Finally, I show that the toy models predict well patterns of dissipation in Europa, Titan and Io. The formalism described in this paper applies to dissipation within solid layers of planets and satellites for which internal spherical symmetry and viscoelastic linear rheology are good approximations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Beuthe","given":"Mikael"}],"citation-key":"Beuthe2013","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2012.11.020","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,1]]},"page":"308-329","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Spatial patterns of tidal heating","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103512004745","volume":"223"},
  {"id":"Beuthe2015","abstract":"Under tidal forcing, icy satellites with subsurface oceans deform as if the surface were a membrane stretched around a fluid layer. 'Membrane worlds' is thus a fitting name for these bodies and membrane theory provides the perfect toolbox to predict tidal effects. I describe here a new membrane approach to tidal perturbations based on the general theory of viscoelastic-gravitational deformations of spherically symmetric bodies. The massive membrane approach leads to explicit formulas for viscoelastic tidal Love numbers which are exact in the limit of zero crust thickness. Formulas for load Love numbers come as a bonus. The accuracy on k2 and h2 is better than one percent if the crust thickness is less than five percents of the surface radius, which is probably the case for Europa and Titan. The new approach allows for density differences between crust and ocean and correctly includes crust compressibility. This last feature makes it more accurate than the incompressible propagator matrix method. Membrane formulas factorize shallow and deep interior contributions, the latter affecting Love numbers mainly through density stratification. I show that a screening effect explains why ocean stratification typically increases Love numbers instead of reducing them. For Titan, a thin and dense liquid layer at the bottom of a light ocean can raise k2 by more than ten percents. The membrane approach can also deal with dynamical tides in a non-rotating body. I show that a dynamical resonance significantly decreases the tilt factor and may thus lead to underestimating Europa's crust thickness.

  {"id":"Beuthe2015a","abstract":"Jupiter's moon Europa has a thin icy crust which is decoupled from the mantle by a subsurface ocean. The crust thus responds to tidal forcing as a deformed membrane, cold at the top and near melting point at the bottom. In this paper I develop the membrane theory of viscoelastic shells with depth-dependent rheology with the dual goal of predicting tidal tectonics and computing tidal dissipation. Two parameters characterize the tidal response of the membrane: the effective Poisson's ratio ν- and the membrane spring constant Λ, the latter being proportional to the crust thickness and effective shear modulus. I solve membrane theory in terms of tidal Love numbers, for which I derive analytical formulas depending on Λ,ν-, the ocean-to-bulk density ratio and the number k2 representing the influence of the deep interior. Membrane formulas predict h2 and k2 with an accuracy of a few tenths of percent if the crust thickness is less than one hundred kilometers, whereas the error on l2 is a few percents. Benchmarking with the thick-shell software SatStress leads to the discovery of an error in the original, uncorrected version of the code that changes stress components by up to 40%. Regarding tectonics, I show that different stress-free states account for the conflicting predictions of thin and thick shell models about the magnitude of tensile stresses due to nonsynchronous rotation. Regarding dissipation, I prove that tidal heating in the crust is proportional to Im(Λ) and that it is equal to the global heat flow (proportional to Im(k2)) minus the core-mantle heat flow (proportional to Im(k2)). As an illustration, I compute the equilibrium thickness of a convecting crust.

Earthlike models of dynamical tides give no definitive answer because they neglect the influence of the crust. I propose here the first model of dissipative tides in a subsurface ocean, by combining the Laplace Tidal Equations with the membrane approach. For the first time, it is possible to compute tidal dissipation rates within the crust, ocean, and mantle in one go. I show that oceanic dissipation is strongly reduced by the crustal constraint, and thus contributes little to Enceladus’ present heat budget. Tidal resonances could have played a role in a forming or freezing ocean less than 100Â m deep. The model is general: it applies to all icy satellites with a thin crust and a shallow ocean. Scaling rules relate the resonances and dissipation rate of a subsurface ocean to the ones of a surface ocean. If the ocean has low viscosity, the westward obliquity tide does not move the crust.

  {"id":"Beuthe2018","abstract":"The geologic activity at Enceladus's south pole remains unexplained, though tidal deformations are probably the ultimate cause. Recent gravity and libration data indicate that Enceladus's icy crust floats on a global ocean, is rather thin, and has a strongly non-uniform thickness. Tidal effects are enhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of tidal tectonics and dissipation should take into account the lateral variations of shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic thin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations of shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2D linear partial differential equations of the fourth order on the sphere which take into account self-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity. If the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas for tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5% and 15%, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10% of the radius. If the shell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of coupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis. Compared to finite element models, thin shell predictions are similar for the deformations due to Enceladus's pressurized ocean, but differ for the tides of Ganymede. If Enceladus's shell is conductive with isostatic thickness variations, surface stresses are approximately inversely proportional to the local shell thickness. The radial tide is only moderately enhanced at the south pole. The combination of crustal thinning and convection below the poles can amplify south polar stresses by a factor of 10, but it cannot explain the apparent time lag between the maximum plume brightness and the opening of tiger stripes.

  {"id":"Beuthe2019","abstract":"Tidal heating is the prime suspect behind Enceladus's south polar heating anomaly and global subsurface ocean. No model of internal tidal dissipation, however, can explain at the same time the total heat budget and the focusing of the energy at the south pole. I study here whether the non-uniform icy shell thickness can cause the north-south heating asymmetry by redistributing tidal heating either in the shell or in the core. Starting from the non-uniform tidal thin shell equations, I compute the volumetric rate, surface flux, and total power generated by tidal dissipation in shell and core. The micro approach is supplemented by a macro approach providing an independent determination of the core-shell partition of the total power. Unless the shell is incompressible, the assumption of a uniform Poisson's ratio implies non-zero bulk dissipation. If the shell is laterally uniform, the thin shell approach predicts shell dissipation with a few percent error while the error on core dissipation is negligible. Variations in shell thickness strongly increase the shell dissipation flux where the shell is thinner. For a hard shell with long-wavelength variations, the shell dissipation flux can be predicted by scaling with the inverse local thickness the flux for a laterally uniform shell. If Enceladus's shell is in conductive thermal equilibrium with isostatic thickness variations, the shell dissipation flux at the south pole is about three times its value for a shell of uniform thickness, which remains negligible compared to the observed flux. Spatial variations of the observed flux can only be reproduced if the ice at the bottom of the shell is ten times more dissipative at tidal frequencies than in standard models of ice rheology. Dissipation in an unconsolidated core can provide the missing power if the rheology of the core is extremely soft, but does not generate any significant heating asymmetry as long as the core is homogeneous. Non-steady state models, though not investigated here, face similar difficulties in explaining the asymmetries of tidal heating and shell thickness.","author":[{"family":"Beuthe","given":"Mikael"}],"citation-key":"Beuthe2019","container-title":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2019.05.035","ISSN":"10902643","issue":"May","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"66-91","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Enceladus's crust as a non-uniform thin shell: II tidal dissipation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2019.05.035","volume":"332"},

We present new measurements of sectoral equatorial inertial modes at m > 15 where the modes appear to become progressively less retrograde compared to the canonical Rossby-Haurwitz dispersion relation in a corotating frame. We use a spectral eigenvalue solver to compute the spectrum of solar inertial modes in the presence of differential rotation. Focussing specifically on equatorial Rossby modes, we find that the numerically obtained mode frequencies lie along distinct ridges, one of which lies strikingly close to the observed mode frequencies in the Sun. We also find that the n = 0 ridge is deflected strongly in the retrograde direction. This suggests that the solar measurements may not correspond to the fundamental n = 0 Rossby-Haurwitz solutions as was initially suspected, but to a those for a higher n.

  {"id":"BierstekerEtAl2023","abstract":"Some icy moons and small bodies in the solar system are believed to host subsurface liquid water oceans. The interaction of these saline, electrically conductive oceans with time-varying external magnetic ﬁelds generates induced magnetic ﬁelds. Magnetometry observations of these induced ﬁelds in turn enable the detection and characterization of these oceans. We present a framework for characterizing the interiors of icy moons using multifrequency induction and Bayesian inference applied to magnetometry measurements anticipated from the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. Using simulated data from the Europa Clipper Magnetometer, our approach can accurately retrieve a wide range of plausible internal structures for Europa. In particular, the ocean conductivity is recovered to within ±50% for all internal structure scenarios considered, and the ocean thickness can be retrieved to within ±25 km for ﬁve out of seven scenarios. Characterization of the ice shell thickness to ±50% is possible for six of seven scenarios. Our recovery of the ice shell thickness is highly contingent on accurate modeling of magnetic ﬁelds arising from the interaction of Europa with the ambient magnetospheric plasma, while the ocean thickness is more modestly affected and the ocean conductivity retrieval is largely unchanged. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the addition of a priori constraints (e.g., static gravity measurements) can yield improved ocean characterization compared to magnetometry alone, suggesting that multi-instrument techniques can play a key role in revealing the interiors of Europa and other ocean worlds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Biersteker","given":"John B."},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Benjamin P."},{"family":"Cochrane","given":"Corey J."},{"family":"Harris","given":"Camilla D.

  {"id":"Bills2005","abstract":"The obliquity, or angular separation between orbit normal and spin pole, is an important parameter for the geodynamics of most Solar System bodies. Tidal dissipation has driven the obliquities of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter to small, but non-zero values. We present estimates of the free and forced obliquities of these satellites using a simple secular variation model for the orbits, and spin pole precession rate estimates based on gravity field parameters derived from Galileo spacecraft encounters. The free obliquity values are not well constrained by observations, but are presumed to be very small. The forced obliquity variations depend only on the orbital variations and the spin pole precession rate parameters, which are quite well known.

  {"id":"BireEtAl2022","abstract":"We numerically explore convection and general circulation of an ocean, encased in a spherical shell of uniform thickness, heated from below by a spatially uniform heat flux, and whose temperature at the upper surface is relaxed to the freezing point of water. The role of salt is not considered. We describe the phenomenology and equilibrium solutions across a broad range of two key non-dimensional numbers: the natural Rossby number, a measure of the influence of rotation, and the ratio of inner to outer radius of the moon's ocean, a measure of the geometry of the moon's tangent cylinder. Two distinct regimes of circulation are identified, both dominated by Taylor columns aligned with the rotation axis—“plumes” and “rolls” which predominate inside and outside the tangent cylinder, respectively. Inside the tangent cylinder, convective plumes align with Taylor columns that extend from the bottom to the ice shell. The plumes energize geostrophic turbulence which in turn generates a general circulation consisting counter-rotating zonal jets. Moreover, the plumes are efficient at transferring heat from the bottom to the surface, resulting in loss of heat from the ocean to the polar ice. If the plumes are suppressed rolls outside the tangent cylinder become the dominant mode of heat transfer resulting in equatorial cooling. We conclude that if moons such as Enceladus and Europa were to be predominantly heated from below, they will likely have a “Jovian-like” circulation: an unstratified, turbulent, geostrophically controlled ocean with strong “Taylor column” behavior and a circulation dominated by counterrotating zonal jets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Bire","given":"Suyash"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Wanying"},{"family":"Ramadhan","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Campin","given":"Jean‐Michel"},{"family":"Marshall","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"BireEtAl2022","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","container-title-short":"JGR Planets","DOI":"10.1029/2021JE007025","ISSN":"2169-9097, 2169-9100","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Exploring Ocean Circulation on Icy Moons Heated From Below","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JE007025","volume":"127"},

In relevant studies, people attempt to discriminate lies from truths in real time with no special aids or training. In these circumstances, people achieve an average of 54% correct lie-truth judgments, correctly classifying 47% of lies as deceptive and 61% of truths as nondeceptive. Relative to cross-judge differences in accuracy, mean lie-truth discrimination abilities are nontrivial, with a mean accuracy d of roughly .40. This produces an effect that is at roughly the 60th percentile in size, relative to others that have been meta-analyzed by social psychologists. Alternative indexes of lie-truth discrimination accuracy correlate highly with percentage correct, and rates of lie detection vary little from study to study. Our meta-analyses reveal that people are more accurate in judging audible than visible lies, that people appear deceptive when motivated to be believed, and that individuals regard their interaction partners as honest. We propose that people judge others' deceptions more harshly than their own and that this double standard in evaluating deceit can explain much of the accumulated literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bond","given":"Charles F."},{"family":"DePaulo","given":"Bella M."}],"citation-key":"BondDePaulo2006","container-title":"Personality and Social Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Pers Soc Psychol Rev","DOI":"10.1207/s15327957pspr1003_2","ISSN":"1088-8683","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"214-234","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Accuracy of Deception Judgments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr1003_2","volume":"10"},

Separation of variables for the Laplace operator yields an analytic solution as a Fourier-Bessel series, but this usually converges at an algebraic (sub-spectral) rate. The cylindrical Robert functions converge geometrically but are horribly ill-conditioned. The Zernike and Logan-Shepp polynomials span the same space, that of Cartesian polynomials of a given total degree, but the former allows partial factorization whereas the latter basis facilitates an efficient algorithm for solving the Poisson equation. The Zernike polynomials were independently rediscovered several times as the product of one-sided Jacobi polynomials in radius with a Fourier series in ?? Generically, the Zernike basis requires only half as many degrees of freedom to represent a complicated function on the disk as does a Chebyshev-Fourier basis, but the latter has the great advantage of being summed and interpolated entirely by the Fast Fourier Transform instead of the slower matrix multiplication transforms needed in radius by the Zernike basis. Conformally mapping a square to the disk and employing a bivariate Chebyshev expansion on the square is spectrally accurate, but clustering of grid points near the four singularities of the mapping makes this method less efficient than the rest, meritorious only as a quick-and-dirty way to adapt a solver-for-the-square to the disk.

  {"id":"BreuerEtAl2015","abstract":"Recent planetary space missions, new experimental data, and advanced numerical techniques have helped to improve our understanding of the deep interiors of the terrestrial planets and moons. In the present review, we summarize recent insights into the state and composition of their iron (Fe)-rich cores, as well as recent findings about the magnetic field evolution of Mercury, the Moon, Mars, and Ganymede. Crystallizing processes in iron-rich cores that differ from the classical Earth case (i.e., Fe snow and iron sulfide (FeS) crystallization) have been identified and found to be important in the cores of terrestrial bodies. The Fe snow regime occurs at pressures lower than that in the Earth’s core on the iron-rich side of the eutectic, where iron freezes first close to the core–mantle boundary rather than in the center. FeS crystallization, instead, occurs on the sulfur-rich side of the eutectic. Depending on the core temperature profile and the pressure range considered, FeS crystallizes either in the core center or close to the core–mantle boundary. The consequences of the various crystallizing mechanisms for core dynamics and magnetic field generation are discussed. For the Moon, revised paleomagnetic data obtained with advanced techniques suggest a peculiar history of its internal dynamo, with an early strong field persisting between 4.25 and 3.5 Ga, and subsequently a much weaker field. In addition, the long-lasting dynamo and the possible presence of an inner core, as inferred from a revised interpretation of Apollo seismic data, suggest core crystallization as a viable process of magnetic field generation for a substantial period during lunar evolution. The present-day magnetic fields of Mercury and Ganymede (if they occur on the iron-rich side of the Fe–FeS eutectic) and the related dynamo action are likely generated in the Fe snow regime and seem to be recent features. An earlier dynamo in Mercury would have been powered differently. For Mercury, MESSENGER data further suggest core formation under reducing conditions that may have resulted in an Fe–S–Si composition, further complicating the core crystallization process. Mars, with its early and strong paleo-field, likely has not yet started to freeze out an inner iron core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Breuer","given":"Doris"},{"family":"Rueckriemen","given":"Tina"},{"family":"Spohn","given":"Tilman"}],"citation-key":"BreuerEtAl2015","container-title":"Progress in Earth and Planetary Science","container-title-short":"Progress in Earth and Planetary Science","DOI":"10.1186/s40645-015-0069-y","ISSN":"2197-4284","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,16]]},"page":"39","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Iron snow, crystal floats, and inner-core growth: modes of core solidification and implications for dynamos in terrestrial planets and moons","title-short":"Iron snow, crystal floats, and inner-core growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-015-0069-y","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"Bryan1889","abstract":"1. The hydrodynamical problem of finding the waves or oscillations on a gravitating mass of liquid which, when undisturbed, is rotating as if rigid with finite angular velocity, in the form of an ellipsoid or spheroid, was first successfully attacked by M. Poincaré in 1885. In his important memoir, “Sur l’Équilibre d’une Masse Fluide animée dun Mouvement de Rotation,” Poincare has (§ 13) obtained the differential equations for the oscillations of rotating liquid, and shown that, by a transformation of projection, the determination of the oscillations of any particular period is reducible to finding a suitable solution of Laplace’s equation. He then applies Lamé’s functions to the case of the ellipsoid, showing that the differential equations are satisfied by a series of Lamé’s functions referred to a certain auxiliary ellipsoid, the boundary-conditions, however, involving ellipsoidal harmonics, referred to both the auxiliary and actual fluid ellipsoid. At the same time, Poincare’s analysis does not appear to admit of any definite conclusions being formed as to the nature and frequencies of the various periodic free waves. The present paper contains an application of Poincaré’s methods to the simpler case when the fluid ellipsoid is one of revolution (Maclaurin’s spheroid). The solution is effected by the use of the ordinary tesseral or zonal harmonics applicable to the fluid spheroid and to the auxiliary spheroid required in solving the differential equation. The problem is thus freed from the difficulties attending the use of Lamé’s functions, and is further simplified by the fact that each independent solution contains harmonics of only one particular degree and rank.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Bryan","given":"George Hartley"}],"citation-key":"Bryan1889","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This study emphasizes short-wavelength phenomena so that a Cartesian approximation of the boundary region can be used to identify the main processes without introducing the additional complications of spherical geometry. Conductivity variations in the mantle are confined to a thin layer, coinciding roughly with the D” region, while boundary irregularities are assumed to be small so that perturbation methods are applicable. Solutions for the full hydromagnetic disturbance in the fluid core are calculated using a spectral method in which the unknown velocity and magnetic perturbations are expanded in Laguerre polynomials. The most significant perturbations arise in the magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), which can be as large as 1 - 2 x l o p 4T for plausible levels of mantle heterogeneity. Such large perturbations would represent a significant fraction of the total field at the C M B and may account for those features in the field which appear stationary. These magnetic perturbations would also affect the mechanical coupling between the core and the mantle. Estimates of the magnetic shear stress on the mantle increase by a factor of two with the additional field induced by the effects of 2 k m boundary topography. Fluid pressure and magnetic normal stresses act on the boundary topography to make an additional contribution to the force couple.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce A."}],"citation-key":"Buffett1996","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.1996.tb06552.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",4]]},"language":"en","page":"303-317","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of a heterogeneous mantle on the velocity and magnetic fields at the top of the core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1996.tb06552.x","volume":"125"},

  {"id":"Buffett2015","abstract":"Interactions between the core and the mantle arise when heat, mass, momentum, or charge is transferred across the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Each of these interactions has consequences for the dynamics and evolution of the Earth's interior. Thermal interactions are a result of changes in the magnitude or spatial pattern of heat flow across the CMB. These interactions evolve slowly on the timescale of convective overturn in the mantle (nominally 107-108years). The style of convection in the core and the regeneration of the magnetic field can be dramatically altered by plausible changes in CMB heat flow. Electromagnetic and mechanical interactions occur on shorter timescales and may be responsible for observed fluctuations in the Earth's rotation rate over periods ranging from several decades to several days. More uncertain are chemical interactions, which result from the transfer of mass across the CMB. Differences in the oxidation state of the core and the mantle make chemical reactions between these two regions likely, yet the evidence for mass exchange remains controversial. We review recent advances in our understanding of core-mantle interactions. We also explore the role of core-mantle interactions in making internal processes detectable at the Earth's surface.","author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"B.

  {"id":"Buffett2021","abstract":"Ekman layers develop at the boundaries of the Earth’s fluid core in response to precession. Instabilities in these layers lead to turbulence when a local Reynolds number, Re, based on the thickness of the Ekman layer, exceeds a critical value. The transition to turbulence is often assessed using experiments for steady Ekman layers, where the interior geostrophic flow is independent of time. Precessionally driven flow varies on diurnal timescales, so the transition to turbulence may occur at a different value of Re. We use 3-D numerical calculations in a local Cartesian geometry to assess the transition to turbulence in precessional flow. Calculations retain the horizontal component of the rotation vector and account for the influence of fluid stratification. The transition to turbulence in a neutrally stratified fluid occurs near Re = 500, which is higher than the value Re = 150 usually cited for steady Ekman layers. However, it is comparable to the nominal value for precessional flow in the Earth. Complications due to fluid stratification or a magnetic field can suppress the transition to turbulence, reducing the likelihood of turbulent Ekman layers in the Earth’s core.","author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"B A"}],"citation-key":"Buffett2021","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggab088","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"56-65","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Conditions for turbulent Ekman layers in precessionally driven flow","type":"article-journal","volume":"226"},
  {"id":"BuffettChristensen2007","abstract":"Dissipative core-mantle coupling is evident in observations of the Earth's nutations, although the source of this coupling is uncertain. Magnetic coupling occurs when conducting materials on either side of the boundary move through a magnetic field. In order to explain the nutation observations with magnetic coupling, we must assume a high (metallic) conductivity on the mantle side of the boundary and a rms radial field of 0.69 mT. Much of this field occurs at short wavelengths, which cannot be observed directly at the surface. High levels of short-wavelength field impose demands on the power needed to regenerate the field through dynamo action in the core. We use a numerical dynamo model from the study of Christensen & Aubert (2006) to assess whether the required short-wavelength field is physically plausible. By scaling the numerical solution to a model with sufficient short-wavelength field, we obtain a total ohmic dissipation of 0.7-1 TW, which is within current uncertainties. Viscous coupling is another possible explanation for the nutation observations, although the effective viscosity required for this is 0.03 m2 s-1 or higher. Such high viscosities are commonly interpreted as an eddy viscosity. However, physical considerations and laboratory experiments limit the eddy viscosity to 10-4 m2 s-1, which suggests that viscous coupling can only explain a few percent of the dissipative torque between the core and the mantle. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 RAS.","author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"B.

  {"id":"BuffettEtAl2009","abstract":"Oscillations in Earth's liquid core with periods of several decades are inferred from variations in the magnetic field. The observed periods are consistent with a type of hydromagnetic wave known as torsional oscillations. These oscillations represent a set of very-low-frequency normal modes in which the internal magnetic field provides the primary restoring force. By adapting the methods of normal-mode seismology, we construct estimates for the internal structure of the magnetic field and several other key parameters, including the viscosity of the inner core. The structure of the recovered field provides useful insights into the nature of convection. We find evidence of columnar convection in the core, and estimate the strength of the field generated by these flows (≈0.3 mT). We also use the normal modes to recover the excitation source for the oscillations. Much of the excitation appears to originate near the surface of a cylinder that is tangent to the equator of the inner core. Distinct events rise above a background level of excitation, and may be related to instabilities in the geodynamo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce A."},{"family":"Mound","given":"Jon"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"BuffettEtAl2009","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04129.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,1]]},"page":"878-890","source":"Silverchair","title":"Inversion of torsional oscillations for the structure and dynamics of Earth's core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04129.x","volume":"177"},

One class of waves with periods of several decades is known to arise from an interplay between magnetic, Archimedes and Coriolis forces. These so-called MAC waves are thought to be relevant for interpreting historical fluctuations in the geomagnetic field. In this study, we show that MAC waves provide a good description of time-dependent zonal flow at the top of the core. The same collection of waves also offers a simple explanation for observed fluctuations in the dipole field. Both of these predictions require a stratified layer at the top of the core with a thickness of 130-140 km and a buoyancy frequency comparable to Earth's rotation rate. We extend these predictions to include changes in the length of day (LOD) and find that MAC waves can account for about half of the observed fluctuation at decadal periods. Larger fluctuations are possible when electromagnetic stresses couple MAC waves to flow in the interior of the core. In fact, an idealized model for the coupled motion overestimates the LOD fluctuations, probably reflecting limitations in this idealized model. Our results offer support for stable stratification at the top of the core and suggest a common origin for decadal fluctuations in the geomagnetic field and the LOD.","author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Knezek","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Holme","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"BuffettEtAl2016","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggv552","ISSN":"1365246X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1789-1800","title":"Evidence for MAC waves at the top of Earth's core and implications for variations in length of day","type":"article-journal","volume":"204"},
  {"id":"BuffettMatsui2019","abstract":"Short-period fluctuations in geomagnetic acceleration are detected in recent satellite observations. A major component of this signal is confined to the equatorial region, suggesting the presence of equatorial waves, but the precise nature of these waves is not known. We explore the possibility that these waves arise from an interplay of magnetic, Archimedes and Coriolis forces in a stratified layer at the top of the core (sometimes called MAC waves). We adopt a beta-plane approximation and show that low-frequency MAC waves are not trapped near the equator when the root-mean-square (rms) radial magnetic field is constant over the surface of the core–mantle boundary. However, equatorial trapped MAC waves emerge when the rms radial magnetic field increases towards the poles. Further confinement of MAC waves occurs when we account for the leading-order effects of spherical geometry. The resulting MAC waves propagate to the east with phase velocities that depend strongly on the thickness of the stratified layer. Waves with periods less than 10 yr are predicted when the layer thickness is less than 30 km. These waves have low quality factors, Q ≈ 1, which means that they propagate only a few thousand kilometers before being dissipated by ohmic losses. Evidence for eastward and westward propagating disturbances in the observations may reflect a superposition of wave propagation and forced motion by an excitation source. Separation of the source from the wave propagation may be possible if the source is due mainly to westward drifting plumes in the equatorial region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce"},{"family":"Matsui","given":"Hiroaki"}],"citation-key":"BuffettMatsui2019","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggz233","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"page":"1210-1225","source":"Silverchair","title":"Equatorially trapped waves in Earth’s core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz233","volume":"218"},

The Dedalus Project is a flexible, open-source, parallelized computational framework for solving general partial differential equations using spectral methods. Dedalus translates plain-text strings describing partial differential equations into efficient solvers. This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom analysis outputs can also be specified in plain text and stored in self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation.

However, the interpretation of gravity, shape, and libration data leads to contradicting results regarding the depth of ocean/ice interface and the total volume of the ocean. Here we develop an interior structure model consisting of a rocky core, an internal ocean, and an ice shell, which satisfies simultaneously the gravity, shape, and libration data. We show that the data can be reconciled by considering isostatic compensation including the effect of a few hundred meter thick elastic lithosphere. Our model predicts that the core radius is 180–185 km, 3 the ocean density is at least 1030 kg/m , and the ice shell is 18–22 km thick on average.

Assuming that the rocky core is homogeneous and in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a set of structural models that accurately reproduce the main characteristics of Enceladus’ gravity field. In order to restrict the range of acceptable models we analyze the degree of compensation (ratio of the bottom to the surface load) at spherical harmonic degrees well constrained by the gravity data. In agreement with previous studies, we find that Enceladus’ ice shell is close to equilibrium, with the degree of compensation approaching one for models with a hydrostatic core having a radius between 190 km and 195 km. By computing the flow of ice driven by variations in hydrostatic pressure on the ice water/interface, we demonstrate that the ice shell is in steady state, as suggested by the gravity and shape data, only if the viscosity of ice at the melting temperature is equal to or higher than 3 × 1014 Pa s, corresponding to diffusion creep with a grain size of 1 mm or larger. The topographic anomalies are maintained by phase changes at the ice/water interface with a melting/freezing rate of a few mm/yr or smaller. This process is controlled by the heat flux at the top of the ocean, characterized by a strong degree-2 zonal component with amplitudes exceeding 60 mW/m2 in both south and north polar regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Čadek","given":"Ondřej"},{"family":"Souček","given":"Ondřej"},{"family":"Běhounková","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Choblet","given":"Gaël"},{"family":"Tobie","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Hron","given":"Jaroslav"}],"citation-key":"CadekEtAl2019","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2018.10.003","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"476-484","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Long-term stability of Enceladus’ uneven ice shell","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103518303762","volume":"319"},
  {"id":"CaiEtAl2021","abstract":"In this paper, we have studied convectively coupled equatorially trapped waves in rotating stars, with and without magnetic ﬁelds. The equatorial trapped hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic Poincaré, Rossby, mixed Rossby–Poincaré, and Kelvin waves were identiﬁed. The effects of stratiﬁcation and nontraditional Coriolis force terms have been investigated. When the ﬂow is strongly stratiﬁed, the wave frequencies of the convectively coupled model are almost the same as those of a shallow-water model. However, when the ﬂow is weakly stratiﬁed, the wave frequencies are constrained by the buoyancy frequency. The nontraditional Coriolis terms affect the widths and phases of the equatorial waves. The width increases with an increasing nontraditional Coriolis parameter. Phase shift occurs when the nontraditional Coriolis parameter is included. The magnetic effect is signiﬁcant when the magnetic ﬁeld is strong. We have applied the model in the solar atmosphere and solar tachocline to explain the Rieger-type periodicities. For the solar atmosphere, when the magnetic effect is taken into account, we ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁeld should be smaller than 5 G in the solar photosphere. Otherwise, the Riegertype periodicities can only be attributed to long Rossby waves. For the solar tachocline, we ﬁnd that magnetic ﬁeld of the solar tachocline should be smaller than 50 kG to observe the 160 day Rieger period. In addition, we ﬁnd that the effect of the nontraditional Coriolis terms is not obvious in the solar photosphere, but its effect on the tachocline is signiﬁcant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Xing"}],"citation-key":"CaiEtAl2021","container-title":"The Astrophysical Journal","container-title-short":"ApJ","DOI":"10.3847/1538-4357/abf92a","ISSN":"0004-637X, 1538-4357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"11","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Convectively Coupled Equatorial Trapped Waves in Stars and Planets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abf92a","volume":"914"},

  {"id":"Campos2007","abstract":"The starting point in the formulation of most acoustic problems is the acoustic wave equation. Those most widely used, the classical and convected wave equations, have significant restrictions, i.e., apply only to linear, nondissipative sound waves in a steady homogeneous medium at rest or in uniform motion. There are many practical situations violating these severe restrictions. In the present paper 36 distinct forms of the acoustic wave equation are derived (and numbered W1-W36), extending the classical and convected wave equations to include cases of propagation in inhomogeneous and/or unsteady media, either at rest or in potential or vortical flows. The cases considered include: (i) linear waves, i.e., with small gradients, which imply small amplitudes, and (ii) nonlinear waves, i.e., with steep gradients, which include \"ripples\" (large gradients with small amplitude) or large amplitude waves. Only nondissipative waves are considered, i.e., excluding and dissipation by shear and bulk viscosity and thermal conduction. Consideration is given to propagation in homogeneous media and inhomogeneous media, which are homentropic (i.e., have uniform entropy) or isentropic (i.e., entropy is conserved along streamlines), excluding nonisentropic (e.g., dissipative); unsteady media are also considered. The medium may be at rest, in uniform motion, or it may be a nonuniform and/or unsteady mean flow, including: (i) potential mean flow, of low Mach number (i.e., incompressible mean state) or of high-speed (i.e., inhomogeneous compressible mean flow); (ii) quasi-one-dimensional propagation in ducts of varying cross section, including horns without mean flow and nozzles with low or high Mach number mean flow; or (iii) unidirectional sheared mean flow, in the plane, in space or axisymmetric. Other types of vortical mean flows, e.g., axisymmetric swirling mean flow, possibly combined with shear, are not considered in the present paper (and are left to follow-up work together with dissipative and other cases). The 36 wave equations are derived either by elimination among the general equations of fluid mechanics or from an acoustic variational principle, with both methods being used in a number of cases as cross-checks. Although the 36 forms of the acoustic wave equation do not cover all possible combinations of the three effects of (i) nonlinearity in (ii) inhomogeneous and unsteady and (iii) nonuniformly moving media, they do include each effect in isolation and a variety of combinations of multiple effects. Altogether they provide a useful variety of extensions of the classical (and convected) wave equations, which are used widely in the literature, in spite of being restricted to linear, nondissipative sound waves in an homogeneous steady medium at rest (or in uniform motion). There are many applications for which the classical and convected wave equations are poor approximations, and more general forms of the acoustic wave equation provide more satisfactory models. Numerous examples of these applications are given at the end of each written section. There are 240 references cited in this review article.

  {"id":"Castillo-RogezEtAl2023","abstract":"The five large moons of Uranus are important targets for future spacecraft missions. To motivate and inform the exploration of these moons, we model their internal evolution, present-day physical structures, and geochemical and geophysical signatures that may be measured by spacecraft. We predict that if the moons preserved liquid until present, it is likely in the form of residual oceans less than 30 km thick in Ariel, Umbriel, and less than 50 km in Titania, and Oberon. The preservation of liquid strongly depends on material properties and, potentially, on dynamical circumstances that are presently unknown. Miranda is unlikely to host liquid at present unless it experienced tidal heating a few tens of million years ago. We find that since the thin residual layers may be hypersaline, their induced magnetic fields could be detectable by future spacecraft-based magnetometers. However, if the ocean is maintained primarily by ammonia, and thus well below the water freezing point, then its electrical conductivity may be too small to be detectable by spacecraft. Lastly, our calculated tidal Love number (k2) and dissipation factor (Q) are consistent with the Q/k2 values previously inferred from dynamical evolution models. In particular, we find that the low Q/k2 estimated for Titania supports the hypothesis that Titania currently holds an ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Castillo-Rogez","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Weiss","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Beddingfield","given":"Chloe"},{"family":"Biersteker","given":"John"},{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Goode","given":"Allison"},{"family":"Melwani Daswani","given":"Mohit"},{"family":"Neveu","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"Castillo-RogezEtAl2023","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","DOI":"10.1029/2022JE007432","ISSN":"2169-9100","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and The Authors.

  {"id":"CebronEtAl2019","abstract":"Precession of planets or moons affects internal liquid layers by driving ﬂows, instabilities and possibly dynamos. The energy dissipated by these phenomena can inﬂuence orbital parameters such as the planet’s spin rate. However, there is no systematic study of these ﬂows in the spherical shell geometry relevant for planets, and the lack of scaling law prevents convincing extrapolation to celestial bodies. We have run more than 900 simulations of ﬂuid spherical shells affected by precession, to systematically study basic ﬂows, instabilities, turbulence and magnetic ﬁeld generation. We observe no signiﬁcant effects of the inner core on the onset of the instabilities. We obtain an analytical estimate of the viscous dissipation, mostly due to boundary layer friction in our simulations. We propose theoretical onsets for hydrodynamic instabilities, and document the intensity of turbulent ﬂuctuations. We extend previous precession dynamo studies towards lower viscosities, at the limits of today’s computers. In the low viscosity regime, precession dynamos rely on the presence of large-scale vortices, and the surface magnetic ﬁelds are dominated by small scales. Interestingly, intermittent and self-killing dynamos are observed. Our results suggest that large-scale planetary magnetic ﬁelds are unlikely to be produced by a precession-driven dynamo in a spherical core. But this question remains open as planetary cores are not exactly spherical, and thus the coupling between the ﬂuid and the boundary does not vanish in the relevant limit of small viscosity. Moreover, the fully turbulent dissipation regime has not yet been reached in simulations. Our results suggest that the melted lunar core has been in a turbulent state throughout its history. Furthermore, in the view of recent experimental results, we propose updated formulas predicting the ﬂuid mean rotation vector and the associated dissipation in both the laminar and the turbulent regimes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Cébron","given":"D"},{"family":"Laguerre","given":"R"},{"family":"Noir","given":"J"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"N"}],"citation-key":"CebronEtAl2019","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggz037","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"Supplement_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"S34-S57","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Precessing spherical shells: flows, dissipation, dynamo and the lunar core","title-short":"Precessing spherical shells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/219/Supplement_1/S34/5298488","volume":"219"},

In contrast, the gravitational mechanics traditionally have only seen peripheral mentions of the corresponding (mass-density) multipoles in specific applications. In this paper, we develop the general theory of the multipole formalism for the classical two-body gravitational dynamics, a most prevalent subject in planetary (and global Earth) dynamics. We treat two general, well-encountered configurations: (i) the interior “mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG)” type of configuration consisting of concentric bodies; and (ii) the exterior type of configuration of “planet + satellite” separate bodies in the general form of tidal interactions. We derive concise and exact formulas in terms of multipole expansions; by retaining the leading term(s) of relevance, typically up to the quadrupolar terms that include the planetary triaxiality, one can evaluate to the precision desired while bearing in mind that higher subtleties are readily available in the higher multipole terms. The two-body problems that are so formulated range from potential energy, satellite orbit, to tides, librations of sorts and precession/nutation, to planetary rotational normal modes and wobbles. We demonstrate that, via its various symmetry properties, the multipole formalism provides a theoretical unification framework for these gravitational phenomena that are conventionally treated topic-by-topic in textbook literature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Chao","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Shih","given":"Sheng-An"}],"citation-key":"ChaoShih2021","container-title":"Surveys in Geophysics","container-title-short":"Surv Geophys","DOI":"10.1007/s10712-021-09650-8","ISSN":"0169-3298, 1573-0956","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,23]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multipole Expansion: Unifying Formalism for Earth and Planetary Gravitational Dynamics","title-short":"Multipole Expansion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10712-021-09650-8"},
  {"id":"Chen2010","abstract":"The Earth's rotation is perturbed by mass redistributions and relative motions within the Earth system, as well as by the torques from both the internal Earth and celestial bodies. The present study aims to establish a theory to incorporate all these factors perturbing the rotation state of the triaxial Earth, just like the traditional rotation theory of the axial-symmetric Earth. First of all, we reestimate the Earth's inertia tensor on the basis of two new gravity models, EIGEN-GL05C and EGM2008. Then we formulate the dynamic equations and obtain their normal modes for an Earth model with a triaxial anelastic mantle, a triaxial fluid core, and dissipative oceans. The periods of the Chandler wobble and the free core nutation are successfully recovered, being ∼433 and ∼430 mean solar days, respectively. Further, the Liouville equations and their general solutions for that triaxial nonrigid Earth are deduced. The Liouville equations are characterized by the complex frequency-dependent transfer functions, which incorporate the effects of triaxialities and deformations of both the mantle and the core, as well as the effects of the mantle anelasticity, the equilibrium, and dissipative ocean tides. Complex transfer functions just reflect the fact that decays and phase lags exist in the Earth's response to the periodic forcing. Our theory reduces to the traditional rotation theory of the axial-symmetric Earth when assuming rotational symmetry of the inertia tensor. Finally, the present theory is applied to the case of atmospheric-oceanic excitation. The effective atmospheric-oceanic angular momentum function (AMF) χ eff = χ eff1 + iχ eff2 for the present theory is compared with the AMF χ eff sym = χ eff1 sym + iχ eff2 sym for the traditional theory and the observed AMF χ obs = χ 1 obs + iχ 2 obs ; we find that the difference between χ eff and χ eff sym is of a few milliseconds of arc (mas) and can sometimes exceed 10 mas. In addition, spectrum analyses indicate that χ eff is in good agreement with χ eff sym and, further, show an increase of coherency with χ obs especially in the low-frequency band. The obvious advantage of χ eff in the low-frequency band with respect to χ eff sym is the critical support of the present theory. However, still better performance of our theory can be expected if the models of the mantle anelasticity and oceanic dynamics were improved. Thus we conclude that the traditional Earth rotation theory should be revised and upgraded to include the effects of the Earth's triaxiality, the mantle anelasticity, and oceanic dynamics. The theory presented in this study might be more appropriate to describe the rotation of the triaxial Earth (or other triaxial celestial bodies such as Mars), though further studies are needed to incorporate the effects of the solid inner core and other possible influences.

The release of heat in narrow regions favours intense interaction between water and rock, and the transport of hydrothermal products from the core to the plume sources.

  {"id":"Christensen2006","abstract":"The latest numerical models of the geodynamo can account for the behaviour of Earth's magnetic field pretty well: Mercury has proved a harder nut to crack. Like Earth, it has a dipolar magnetic field, probably generated by a dynamo from convective motions in the planet's liquid iron core. But Mercury's field is a hundred times weaker than Earth's, and this poses a problem for the dynamo theory. A new explanation for the discrepancy has been proposed, accounting for both the observed field strength and the magnetic field geometry observed during the Mariner 10 flybys. The new model assumes that the dynamo operates only deep down in the core, where it generates a strong field. The outer regions of the core are stably layered, so do not convect heat, but they are electrically conducting and the dynamo-generated field is therefore strongly damped.

  {"id":"Christensen2015","abstract":"Ganymede’s internal magnetic field is dominated by the axial dipole. The measurements by the Galileo spacecraft only place an upper limit on the quadrupole moment. Ganymede’s magnetic field has the lowest ratio of quadrupole power to dipole power for all known planetary dynamos, not only at the planetary surface but possibly also at the top of the dynamo region. The dynamo operates in a fluid iron core that probably contains a significant amount of sulfur. Crystallization of the core will then proceed from the top by formation of iron snow in a layer that develops a stable compositional gradient. Remelting of the snow at the bottom of this layer enriches the underlying fluid in iron and drives compositional convection. Here we explore the consequences for the dynamo process of this scenario by numerical modeling. Convection is driven by an imposed buoyancy flux at the top of a convecting core region that is surrounded by a conducting fluid shell with a strongly stabilizing density gradient. Only horizontal flow is allowed in the outer shell. It is shown that this is a valid approximation in the case where the stabilizing density contrast in the upper shell exceeds by far the unstable density contrast in the convecting region. We vary the basic control parameters, concentrating on the regime where the magnetic field is dominantly dipolar. Compared to reference cases without an extra layer above the dynamo, we find that a stable fluid conducting layer with a thickness of 100km or larger reduces the ratio of quadrupole power R2 to dipole power R1 by a factor of at least four. With a stable outer layer R2/R1 is compatible with the Galileo observations for all tested dipolar models, whereas in the absence of such layer R2/R1 is too large or at best marginally compatible. For plausible values of the buoyancy flux the models reproduce Ganymede’s observed dipole moment. A stable layer that is comparable in thickness to the unstable region is found to promote a hemispherical type of dynamo whose field in incompatible with observations. This may indicate that the snow layer in Ganymede’s core has a moderate depth extent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Christensen","given":"Ulrich R."}],"citation-key":"Christensen2015","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2014.10.024","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,1]]},"page":"248-259","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Iron snow dynamo models for Ganymede","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514005715","volume":"247"},
  {"id":"ChristensenAubert2006","abstract":"We study numerically an extensive set of dynamo models in rotating spherical shells, varying all relevant control parameters by at least two orders of magnitude. Convection is driven by a ﬁxed temperature contrast between rigid boundaries. There are two distinct classes of solutions with strong and weak dipole contributions to the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively. Non-dipolar dynamos are found when inertia plays a signiﬁcant role in the force balance. In the dipolar regime the critical magnetic Reynolds number for self-sustained dynamos is of order 50, independent of the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. However, dynamos at low Pm exist only at sufﬁciently low Ekman number E. For dynamos in the dipolar regime we attempt to establish scaling laws that ﬁt our numerical results. Assuming that diffusive effects do not play a primary role, we introduce non-dimensional parameters that are independent of any diffusivity. These are a modiﬁed Rayleigh number based on heat (or buoyancy) ﬂux Ra∗Q, the Rossby number Ro measuring the ﬂow velocity, the Lorentz number Lo measuring magnetic ﬁeld strength, and a modiﬁed Nusselt number Nu∗ for the advected heat ﬂow. To ﬁrst approximation, all our dynamo results can be collapsed into simple power-law dependencies on the modiﬁed Rayleigh number, with approximate exponents of 2/5, 1/2 and 1/3 for the Rossby number, modiﬁed Nusselt number and Lorentz number, respectively. Residual dependencies on the parameters related to diffusion (E, Pm, Prandtl number Pr) are weak. Our scaling laws are in agreement with the assumption that the magnetic ﬁeld strength is controlled by the available power and not necessarily by a force balance. The Elsasser number , which is the conventional measure for the ratio of Lorentz force to Coriolis force, is found to vary widely. We try to assess the relative importance of the various forces by studying sources and sinks of enstrophy (squared vorticity). In general Coriolis and buoyancy forces are of the same order, inertia and viscous forces make smaller and variable contributions, and the Lorentz force is highly variable. Ignoring a possible weak dependence on the Prandtl numbers or the Ekman number, a surprising prediction is that the magnetic ﬁeld strength is independent both of conductivity and of rotation rate and is basically controlled by the buoyancy ﬂux. Estimating the buoyancy ﬂux in the Earth’s core using our Rossby number scaling and a typical velocity inferred from geomagnetic secular variations, we predict a small growth rate and old age of the inner core and obtain a reasonable magnetic ﬁeld strength of order 1 mT inside the core. From the observed heat ﬂow in Jupiter, we predict an internal ﬁeld of 8 mT, in agreement with Jupiter’s external ﬁeld being 10 times stronger than that of the Earth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Christensen","given":"U.

  {"id":"ChristensenEtAl2020","abstract":"Gravity signatures observed by the Juno and Cassini missions that are associated with the strong zonal winds in Jupiter’s and Saturn’s outer envelopes suggest that these ﬂows extend for several thousand kilometers into the interior. It has been noted that the winds seem to abate at a depth where electrical conductivity becomes signiﬁcant, suggesting that electromagnetic effects play a key role for conﬁning the winds to the outer weakly conducting region. Here, we explore the possible mechanisms for braking the zonal ﬂow at depth in two model setups with depth-dependent conductivity and forced jet ﬂow, i.e., in axisymmetric shell models and in more simple linearized box models that allow the exploration of a wide parameter range. Braking of the winds directly by Lorentz forces does not reduce their speed in the conducting region enough to be compatible with the inferred secular variation of Jupiter’s ﬁeld. Stable stratiﬁcation above the depth where conductivity becomes signiﬁcant can solve the problem. Electromagnetic forces drive a weak meridional circulation that perturbs the density distribution in the stable region such that the wind speed decreases strongly with depth, due to a thermal wind balance. For this mechanism to be effective, the stable layer must extend upward into a region of low conductivity. Applying the results of the linearized calculations to Jupiter suggests that the dissipation associated with the zonal winds can be limited to a fraction of the internal heat ﬂow and that the jets may drop off over a depth range of 150–300 km.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Christensen","given":"Ulrich R."},{"family":"Wicht","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Dietrich","given":"Wieland"}],"citation-key":"ChristensenEtAl2020","container-title":"The Astrophysical Journal","container-title-short":"ApJ","DOI":"10.3847/1538-4357/ab698c","ISSN":"1538-4357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,12]]},"language":"en","page":"61","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mechanisms for Limiting the Depth of Zonal Winds in the Gas Giant Planets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab698c","volume":"890"},

  {"id":"ChudinovskikhBoehler2007","abstract":"Melting relations in the Fe–S system were measured in the laser-heated diamond cell by analyzing recovered samples using scanning electron microscopy. The eutectic melting temperatures are lower than in previous diamond-cell studies using in situ melt detection and are in good agreement with recent multi-anvil measurements at lower pressures. The new measurements, ranging from 22 to 44 GPa, show that the eutectic composition becomes increasingly iron-rich with increasing pressure. Thus, if sulfur is the main light component in the Earth's core, the sulfur content would have to be below 10 wt.%, because the density contrast between the inner and outer cores implies that the core composition is on the iron-rich side of the eutectic. At 44 GPa, we find eutectic melting temperatures that are about 1000 K below that of pure iron. Those eutectic temperatures suggest even lower temperatures in the Earth's core than previous measurements on pure iron and, for Mars, they imply a liquid core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Chudinovskikh","given":"Liudmila"},{"family":"Boehler","given":"Reinhard"}],"citation-key":"ChudinovskikhBoehler2007","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2007.02.024","ISSN":"0012821X","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"language":"en","page":"97-103","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Eutectic melting in the system Fe–S to 44 GPa","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X07001045","volume":"257"},

  {"id":"ClesseEtAl2017","abstract":"Spatial averaging and time evolving are non-commutative operations in General Relativity, which questions the reliability of the FLRW model. The long standing issue of the importance of backreactions induced by cosmic inhomogeneities is addressed for a toy model assuming a peak in the primordial spectrum of density perturbations and a simple CDM cosmology. The backreactions of initial Hubble-size inhomogeneities are determined in a fully relativistic framework, from a series of simulations using the BSSN formalism of numerical relativity. In the FLRW picture, these backreactions can be effectively described by two so-called morphon scalar fields, one of them acting at late time like a tiny cosmological constant. Initial density contrasts ranging from $10^{-2}$ down to $10^{-4}$, on scales crossing the Hubble radius between $z\\sim 45 $ and $z\\sim 1000$ respectively, i.e. comoving gigaparsec scales, mimic a Dark Energy (DE) component that can reach $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{DE}} \\approx 0.7$ when extrapolated until today. A similar effect is not excluded for lower density contrasts but our results are then strongly contaminated by numerical noise and thus hardly reliable. A potentially detectable signature of this scenario is a phantom-like equation of state $w< -1$, at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 4$ for a density contrast of $10^{-2}$ initially, relaxing slowly to $w \\approx -1$ today. This new class of scenarios would send the fine-tuning and coincidence issues of Dark energy back to the mechanism at the origin of the primordial power spectrum enhancement, possibly in the context of inflation.","author":[{"family":"Clesse","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Roisin","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Füzfa","given":"André"}],"citation-key":"ClesseEtAl2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"1-14","title":"Mimicking Dark Energy with the backreactions of gigaparsec inhomogeneities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06643","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"ClesseRekier2014","abstract":"We revisit the status of hybrid inflation in the light of Planck and recent BICEP2 results, taking care of possible transient violations of the slow-roll conditions as the field passes from the large field to the vacuum dominated phase. The usual regime where observable scales exit the Hubble radius in the vacuum dominated phase predicts a blue scalar spectrum, which is ruled out. But whereas assuming slow-roll one expects this regime to be generic, by solving the exact dynamics we identify the parameter space for which the small field phase is naturally avoided due to slow-roll violations at the end of the large field phase. When the number of e-folds generated at small field is negligible, the model predictions are degenerated with those of a quadratic potential. There exists also a transitory case for which the small field phase is sufficiently long to affect importantly the observable predictions. Interestingly, in this case the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio agree respectively with the best fit of Planck and BICEP2. This results in a \\Delta \\chi^2 \\simeq 5.0 in favor of hybrid inflation for Planck+BICEP2 (\\Delta \\chi^2 \\simeq 0.9 for Planck only). The last considered regime is when the critical point at which inflation ends is located in the large field phase. It is constrained to be lower than about ten times the reduced Planck mass. The analysis has been conducted with the use of Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo bayesian method, in a reheating consistent way, and we present the posterior probability distributions for all the model parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2014",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Clesse","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Rekier","given":"Jérémy"}],"citation-key":"ClesseRekier2014","container-title":"Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevD.90.083527","ISSN":"15502368","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"1-13","title":"Updated constraints on large field hybrid inflation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.083527","volume":"90"},

  {"id":"ConstableConstable2004","abstract":"Currents induced in Earth by temporal variations in the external magnetic field have long been used to probe mantle electrical conductivity, but almost exclusively from sparsely distributed land observatories. Satellite-borne magnetometers, such as flown on Magsat, Ørsted, and Champ, offer the prospect of improved spatial coverage. The approach we have taken is to isolate induction by harmonic Dst (“disturbance storm time”) excitation of the magnetospheric ring current in satellite magnetic measurements: this is done by removing the magnetic contributions of the main (core) magnetic field, the crustal magnetic field, and ionospheric fields (cause of the daily variation) using Sabaka et al.'s [2000, 2002]CMP3 comprehensive model. The Dst signal is then clearly evident in the midlatitude satellite passes lower than 50 degrees geomagnetic latitude. At higher latitudes, auroral and field aligned currents contaminate the data. We fit the internal and external components of the Dst signal for each equatorial pass, exploiting the fact that the geometry for the internal and external components is different for the azimuthal and radial vector components. The resulting timeseries of internal and external field variations shows that the Dst signals for the dawn passes are half those of the dusk passes. The sum of equatorial external and internal components of the field averaged over dawn and dusk passes provides an excellent estimate for the Dst index, and may in fact be superior when used as a proxy for the purposes of removing induced and magnetospheric fields from satellite magnetic data. We call this estimate satellite Dst. Cross spectral analysis of the internal and external timeseries shows both greater power and higher coherence in the dusk data. We processed the transfer function between internal and external dusk timeseries to provide globally-averaged, frequency dependent impedances that agree well with independently derived estimates. We estimate Earth's radial electrical conductivity structure from these impedances using standard regularized inversion techniques. A near-surface conductor is required, of thickness less than 10 km with a conductivity-thickness product almost exactly that of an average Earth ocean. Inversions suggest that an increase in conductivity at 440 km depth, predicted by recent laboratory measurements on high pressure phases of olivine, is not favored by the data, although, as in previous studies, the 670 km discontinuity between the upper and lower mantle is associated with a two orders of magnitude jump in conductivity. A new feature in our inversions is a further increase in lower mantle conductivity at a depth of 1300 km. A global map of the internal (induced) component of the magnetic field provides a qualitative estimate of three-dimensional (3-D) variations in Earth electrical conductivity, demonstrating graphically that the satellite data are responsive to lateral variations in electrical conductivity caused by the continents and oceans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Constable","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Constable","given":"Catherine"}],"citation-key":"ConstableConstable2004","container-title":"Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems","DOI":"10.1029/2003GC000634","ISSN":"1525-2027","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Observing geomagnetic induction in magnetic satellite measurements and associated implications for mantle conductivity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2003GC000634","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"CoyetteEtAl2016","abstract":"The angular momentum of the atmosphere and of the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan have a large equatorial component that can excite polar motion, a variable orientation of the rotation axis of Titan with respect to its surface. We here use the angular momentum obtained from a General Circulation Model of the atmosphere of Titan and from an Ocean Circulation Model for Titan’s polar lakes to model the polar motion of Titan as a function of the interior structure. Besides the gravitational torque exerted by Saturn on Titan’s aspherical mass distribution, the rotational model also includes torques arising due to the presence of an ocean under a thin ice shell as well as the influence of the elasticity of the different layers. The Chandler wobble period of a solid and rigid Titan without its atmosphere is about 279years. The period of the Chandler wobble is mainly influenced by the atmosphere of Titan (−166years) and the presence of an internal global ocean (+135 to 295years depending on the internal model) and to a lesser extent by the elastic deformations (+3.7years). The forced polar motion of a solid and rigid Titan is elliptical with an amplitude of about 50m and a main period equal to the orbital period of Saturn. It is mainly forced by the atmosphere of Titan while the lakes of Titan are at the origin of a displacement of the mean polar motion, or polar offset. The subsurface ocean can largely increase the polar motion amplitude due to resonant amplification with a wobble free mode of Titan. The amplitudes as well as the main periods of the polar motion depend on whether and which forcing period is close to the period of a free mode. For a thick ice shell, the polar motion mainly has an annual period and an amplitude of about 1km. For thinner ice shells, the polar motion amplitude can reach several tens of km and shorter periods become dominant. We demonstrate that for thick ice shells, the ice shell rigidity weakly influences the amplitude of the polar motion. For thin ice shells, the level of the resonant amplification of the polar motion amplitude depends on the ice shell rigidity. Future observations of the polar motion of Titan could help constraining some properties of its interior structure as the ice shell thickness and ocean density.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Coyette","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Baland","given":"Rose-Marie"},{"family":"Tokano","given":"Tetsuya"}],"citation-key":"CoyetteEtAl2016","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2015.10.015","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-28","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Modeling the polar motion of Titan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515004819","volume":"265"},

In this paper Rayleigh’s principle is used to provide a formalism which allows the approximate computation of the normal mode eigenfrequencies of any Earth model which is slowly rotating and slightly aspherical and anisotropic. This formalism is used to compute, correct to second order, the effects of the Earth’s angular rotation, and correct to first order, the effects of the Earth’s ellipticity of figure on the normal mode eigenfrequencies. It is found that for an arbitrary poloidal or toroidal niultiplet, the central (m= 0) member of the multiplet is shifted slightly in frequency and that the other members of the multiplet are split apart asymmetrically by the effects of the Earth‘s rotation and ellipticity. The results may be used to make a preliminary correction for rotation and ellipticity to the Earth’s raw normal mode data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Dahlen","given":"F.

In particular, the Rossby number, the magnetic Reynolds number, the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy, the Ohmic dissipation timescale and the characteristic aspect ratio of the columnar convection cells are all predicted to be power-law functions of two observable quantities: the magnetic dipole moment and the planetary rotation rate. The resulting scaling laws constitute a somewhat modiﬁed version of the scalings proposed by Christensen and Aubert. The main difference is that, in view of the small value of the Rossby number in planetary cores, we insist that the non-linear inertial term, u · ∇u, is negligible. This changes the exponents in the power-laws which relate the various properties of the ﬂuid dynamo to the planetary dipole moment and rotation rate.

For example, it seems unlikely that viscous forces are at all signiﬁcant in planetary interiors, yet some of the simulations display a signiﬁcant dependence on viscosity, and indeed in some of the simulations the dynamo mechanism is itself viscously driven, taking the form of helical Ekman pumping within columnar convection rolls. Given the similarity of the external magnetic ﬁelds observed in the terrestrial planets and gas giants, and the extremely small value of the Ekman number in all such cases, it seems natural to suppose that the underlying dynamo mechanism in these planets is simple, robust, independent of viscosity and insensitive to mechanical boundary conditions. A key step to identifying this mechanism is to determine the source of helicity in planetary cores, which itself should be robust, independent of viscosity and insensitive to boundary conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Davidson","given":"P.A."}],"citation-key":"Davidson2014","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggu220","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1832-1847","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The dynamics and scaling laws of planetary dynamos driven by inertial waves","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/gji/article/198/3/1832/2874199/The-dynamics-and-scaling-laws-of-planetary-dynamos","volume":"198"},

Efforts to determine the thermal and chemical history of the core have been hindered by poor knowledge of the properties of liquid iron alloys at the extreme pressures and temperatures that exist in the core. This obstacle is now being overcome by high-pressure experiments and advanced mineral physics computations. Using these approaches, updated transport properties for Fe-Si-O mixtures have been determined at core conditions, including electrical and thermal conductivities that are higher than previous estimates by a factor of two to three. Models of core evolution with these high conductivities suggest that the core is cooling much faster than previously thought. This implies that the solid inner core formed relatively recently (around half a billion years ago), and that early core temperatures were high enough to cause partial melting of the lowermost mantle.

  {"id":"DaviesEtAl2021","abstract":"Elucidating the processes in the liquid core that have produced observed palaeointensity changes over the last 3.5 Gyr is crucial for understanding the dynamics and long-term evolution of Earth’s deep interior. We combine numerical geodynamo simulations with theoretical scaling laws to investigate the variation of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld strength over geological time. Our approach follows the study of Aubert et al., adapted to include recent advances in numerical simulations, mineral physics and palaeomagnetism. We ﬁrst compare the ﬁeld strength within the dynamo region and on the core–mantle boundary (CMB) between a suite of 314 dynamo simulations and two power-based theoretical scaling laws. The scaling laws are both based on a Quasi-Geostropic (QG) force balance at leading order and a Magnetic, Archimedian, and Coriolis (MAC) balance at ﬁrst order and differ in treating the characteristic length scale of the convection as ﬁxed (QG-MAC-ﬁxed) or determined as part of the solution (QG-MAC-free). When the data set is ﬁltered to retain only simulations with magnetic to kinetic energy ratios greater than at least two we ﬁnd that the internal ﬁeld together with the root-mean-square and dipole CMB ﬁelds exhibit power-law behaviour that is compatible with both scalings within uncertainties arising from different heating modes and boundary conditions. However, while the extrapolated intensity based on the QG-MAC-free scaling matches Earth’s modern CMB ﬁeld, the QG-MAC-ﬁxed prediction shoots too high and also signiﬁcantly overestimates palaeointensities over the last 3.5 Gyr. We combine the QG-MACfree scaling with outputs from 275 realizations of core–mantle thermal evolution to construct synthetic true dipole moment (TDM) curves spanning the last 3.5 Gyr. Best-ﬁtting TDMs reproduce binned PINT data during the Bruhnes and before inner core nucleation (ICN) within observational uncertainties, but PINT does not contain the predicted strong increase and subsequent high TDMs during the early stages of inner core growth. The best-ﬁtting models are obtained for a present-day CMB heat ﬂow of 11–16 TW, increasing to 17–22 TW at 4 Ga, and predict a minimum TDM at ICN.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Christopher J"},{"family":"Bono","given":"Richard K"},{"family":"Meduri","given":"Domenico G"},{"family":"Aubert","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Greenwood","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Biggin","given":"Andrew J"}],"citation-key":"DaviesEtAl2021","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggab342","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,12]]},"language":"en","page":"316-336","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamo constraints on the long-term evolution of Earth’s magnetic field strength","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/228/1/316/6355447","volume":"228"},

In a thermally advecting core, the fraction of heat available to drive the geodynamo is reduced by heat conducted along the core geotherm, which depends sensitively on the thermal conductivity of liquid iron and its alloys with candidate light elements. The thermal conductivity for Earth's core is very poorly constrained, with current estimates based on a set of scaling relations that were not previously tested at high pressures. We perform first-principles electronic structure computations to determine the thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity for Fe, Fe-Si, and Fe-O liquid alloys. Computed resistivity agrees very well with existing shock compression measurements and shows strong dependence on light element concentration and type. Thermal conductivity at pressure and temperature conditions characteristic of Earth's core is higher than previous extrapolations.

Thanks to the advanced Ka-band radio tracking system, the Geodesy and Geophysics of Jupiter and Galilean Moons (3GM) experiment aboard the mission will provide range and range-rate measurements that will be used to infer the static (up to degree 35–45) and time-varying gravity field and the internal structure of the moon. Ganymede is subject to tidal deformation, which periodically modifies its gravity field. The larger contribution to the time-varying gravity is due to the tidal interaction with Jupiter, modulated by the eccentricity and the inclination of the moon’s orbit. In addition, Ganymede also experiences a lower amplitude time-varying tidal interaction with Io, Europa and Callisto. To a good approximation, the corresponding gravitational signals are periodic and they contain several harmonics of the fundamental synodic frequencies. The elastic response of Ganymede is expected to be frequency-dependent as well. In this work we describe a procedure to estimate the Ganymede’s tidal Love number 𝑘2 at different frequencies in the orbit determination process of the 3GM experiment, supported by numerical simulations. Finally, we show that 3GM measurements can be used to characterize the interior structure of Ganymede, providing a tight constraint on the subsurface ocean thickness.

  {"id":"DewberryEtAl2021","abstract":"Normal mode oscillations in Saturn excite density and bending waves in the C Ring, providing a valuable window into the planet's interior. Saturn's fundamental modes (f modes) excite the majority of the observed waves, while gravito-inertial modes (rotationally modified g modes) associated with stable stratification in the deep interior provide a compelling explanation for additional density waves with low azimuthal wavenumbers m. However, multiplets of density waves with nearly degenerate frequencies, including an m=3 triplet, still lack a definitive explanation. We investigate the effects of rapid and differential rotation on Saturn's oscillations, calculating normal modes for independently constrained interior models. We use a non-perturbative treatment of rotation that captures the full effects of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and consequently the mixing of sectoral f modes with g modes characterized by very different spherical harmonic degrees. Realistic profiles for differential rotation associated with Saturn's zonal winds can enhance these mode interactions, producing detectable oscillations with frequencies separated by less than 1%. Our calculations demonstrate that a three-mode interaction involving an f mode and two g modes can feasibly explain the finely split m=3 triplet, although the fine-tuning required to produce such an interaction generally worsens agreement with seismological constraints provided by m=2 density waves. Our calculations additionally demonstrate that sectoral f mode frequencies are measurably sensitive to differential rotation in Saturn's convective envelope. Finally, we find that including realistic equatorial antisymmetry in Saturn's differential rotation profile couples modes with even and odd equatorial parity, producing oscillations that could in principle excite both density and bending waves simultaneously.","author":[{"family":"Dewberry","given":"Janosz W."},{"family":"Mankovich","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Jim"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wenrui"}],"citation-key":"DewberryEtAl2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"Constraining Saturn's interior with ring seismology: effects of differential rotation and stable stratification","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07659"},

  {"id":"DewberryLai2022","abstract":"Tidal interactions play an important role in many astrophysical systems, but uncertainties regarding the tides of rapidly rotating, centrifugally distorted stars and gaseous planets remain. We have developed a precise method for computing the dynamical, nondissipative tidal response of rotating planets and stars, based on summation over contributions from normal modes driven by the tidal potential. We calculate the normal modes of isentropic polytropes rotating at up to ≃90% of their critical breakup rotation rates, and tabulate fits to mode frequencies and tidal overlap coefficients that can be used to compute the frequency-dependent, nondissipative tidal response (via potential Love numbers k ℓm ). Although fundamental modes (f-modes) possess dominant tidal overlap coefficients at (nearly) all rotation rates, we find that the strong coupling of retrograde inertial modes (i-modes) to tesseral (ℓ > ∣m∣) components of the tidal potential produces resonances that may be relevant to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. The coupling of f-modes in rapid rotators to multiple components of both the driving tidal potential and the induced gravitational field also affect the tesseral response, leading to significant deviations from treatments of rotation that neglect centrifugal distortion and high-order corrections. For very rapid rotation rates (≳70% of breakup), mixing between prograde f-modes and i-modes significantly enhances the sectoral (ℓ = ∣m∣) tidal overlap of the latter. The tidal response of very rapidly rotating, centrifugally distorted planets or stars can also be modified by resonant sectoral f-modes that are secularly unstable via the Chandrasekhar–Friedman–Schutz mechanism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Dewberry","given":"Janosz W."},{"family":"Lai","given":"Dong"}],"citation-key":"DewberryLai2022","container-title":"The Astrophysical Journal","container-title-short":"ApJ","DOI":"10.3847/1538-4357/ac3ede","ISSN":"0004-637X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2]]},"language":"en","page":"124","publisher":"The American Astronomical Society","source":"Institute of Physics","title":"Dynamical Tidal Love Numbers of Rapidly Rotating Planets and Stars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3ede","volume":"925"},

  {"id":"DhouibEtAl2022","abstract":"Asteroseismology has revealed small core-to-the-surface rotation contrasts in stars in the whole HR diagram. This is the signature of strong transport of angular momentum (AM) in stellar interiors. One of the plausible candidates to efficiently carry AM is magnetic fields with various topologies that could be present in stellar radiative zones. Among them, strong axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic fields have received a lot of interest. Indeed, if they are subject to the so-called Tayler instability, the accompanying triggered Maxwell stresses can transport AM efficiently. In addition, the electromotive force induced by the fluctuations of magnetic and velocity fields could potentially sustain a dynamo action that leads to the regeneration of the initial strong axisymmetric azimuthal magnetic field. The key question we aim to answer is: can we detect signatures of these deep strong azimuthal magnetic fields? The only way to answer this question is asteroseismology and the best laboratories of study are intermediate-mass and massive stars. Most of these are rapid rotators during their main-sequence. Therefore, we have to study stellar pulsations propagating in stably stratified, rotating, and potentially strongly magnetised radiative zones. We generalise the traditional approximation of rotation by taking simultaneously general axisymmetric differential rotation and azimuthal magnetic fields into account in a non-perturbative way. Using this new formalism, we derive the asymptotic properties of magneto-gravito-inertial (MGI) waves and their period spacings. We find that toroidal magnetic fields induce a shift in the period spacings of MGI modes. An equatorial azimuthal magnetic field with an amplitude of the order of $10^5\\,\\rm G$ leads to signatures that can be detectable thanks to modern space photometry.

  {"id":"DulingEtAl2014","abstract":"The interaction of planetary bodies with their surrounding magnetized plasma can often be described with the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, which are commonly solved by numerical models. For these models it is necessary to define physically correct boundary conditions for the plasma mass and energy density, the plasma velocity, and the magnetic field. Many planetary bodies have surfaces whose electrical conductivity is negligibly small and thus no electric current penetrates their surfaces. Magnetic boundary conditions, which consider that the associated radial electric current at the planetary surface is zero, are difficult to implement because they include the curl of the magnetic field. Here we derive new boundary conditions by a decomposition of the magnetic field in poloidal and toroidal parts. We find that the toroidal part of the magnetic field needs to vanish at the surface of the insulator. For the spherical harmonics coefficients of the poloidal part, we derive a Cauchy boundary condition, which also matches a possible intrinsic field by including its Gauss coefficients. Thus, we can additionally include planetary dynamo fields as well as time-variable induction fields within electrically conductive subsurface layers. We implement the nonconducting boundary condition in the MHD simulation code ZEUS-MP using spherical geometry and provide a numerical implementation in Fortran 90 as supporting information on the JGR website. We apply it to a model for Ganymede's plasma environment. Our model also includes a consistent set of boundary conditions for the other MHD variables density, velocity, and energy.

  {"id":"Dumberry2010","abstract":"The temporal variation in the density structure associated with convective motions in the outer core causes a change in the Earth's gravity field. Core flows also lead to a gravity change through the global elastic deformations that accompany changes in the non-hydrostatic pressure at the core–mantle boundary (CMB). In this work, we present predictions of the gravity changes from these two processes during the past century. These predictions are built on the basis of flows at the surface of the core that are reconstructed from the observed geomagnetic secular variation. The pressure-induced gravity variations can be reconstructed directly from surface core flows under the assumption of tangential geostrophy; predicted variations in the Stokes coefficients of degree 2, 3 and 4 are of the order of 10-11, 3 × 10-12 and 10-12, respectively, with a typical timescale of a few decades. These correspond to changes in gravity of 70, 30 and 15 nGal, and to equivalent geoid height variations of 0.15, 0.05 and 0.02 mm, respectively. The density-induced gravity variations cannot be determined solely from surface core flows, though a partial recovery is possible if flows with important axial gradients dominate the dynamics at decadal timescales. If this is the case, the density-induced gravity signal is of similar amplitude and generally anti-correlated with the pressure-induced signal, thus reducing the overall amplitude of the gravity changes. However, because we expect decadal flows to be predominantly axially invariant, the amplitude of the density-induced gravity changes should be much smaller. Our prediction also allows to determine upper bounds in pressure change at the CMB and density change within the core that have taken place during the past 20 yr such that observed gravity variations are not exceeded; for harmonic degree 2, we find a maximum pressure change of approximately 350 Pa and a maximum departure from hydrostatic density of approximately 1 part in 107. Although the predicted gravity changes from core flows are small, they are at the threshold of detectability with high-precision gravity measurements from satellite missions such as GRACE. The most important challenge to identifying a core signal will be the removal of interannual gravity variations caused by surface processes which are an order of magnitude larger and mask the core signal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"Dumberry2010","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04437.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,1]]},"page":"635-650","source":"Silverchair","title":"Gravity variations induced by core flows","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04437.x","volume":"180"},

They are caused by the gravitational torque that the Moon, the Sun, and other planets exert on the equatorial bulge. As nutations involve differential rotations between the mantle, fluid core and inner core, the motion of each of these internal regions depends on the coupling between them. In particular, a coupling of a dissipative nature is required to match observations. One possibility is electromagnetic (EM) coupling at the inner and outer core boundaries, the focus of our study. Existing EM coupling models are based on a formulation where the perturbation variables and the equations they must satisfy are defined at local geographic points on the boundary. Here, we show how EM coupling models can be cast under a global formalism, where all variables are expanded in spherical harmonics. This formulation allows a separation of the contribution from the poloidal and toroidal parts of the EM torque, and we show that, under certain conductivity scenarios, this separation is important. © 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2012 RAS.","author":[{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Koot","given":"Laurence"}],"citation-key":"Dumberry2012","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05625.x","ISSN":"0956540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"530-544","title":"A global model of electromagnetic coupling for nutations","type":"article-journal","volume":"191"},
  {"id":"DumberryBloxham2002","abstract":"A tilted inner core permits exchange of angular momentum between the core and the mantle through gravitational and pressure torques and, as a result, changes in the direction of Earth's axis of rotation with respect to the mantle. We have developed a model to calculate the amplitude of the polar motion that results from an equatorial torque at the inner core boundary which tilts the inner core out of alignment with the mantle. We specifically address the issue of the role of the inner core tilt in the decade polar motion known as the Markowitz wobble. We show that a decade polar motion of the same amplitude as the observed Markowitz wobble requires a torque of 1020 N m which tilts the inner core by 0.07 degrees. This result critically depends on the viscosity of the inner core; for a viscosity less than 5 × 1017 Pa s, larger torques are required. We investigate the possibility that a torque of 1020 N m with decadal periodicity can be produced by electromagnetic coupling between the inner core and torsional oscillations of the flow in the outer core. We demonstrate that a radial magnetic field at the inner core boundary of 3 to 4 mT is required to obtain a torque of such amplitude. The resulting polar motion is eccentric and polarized, in agreement with the observations. Our model suggests that equatorial torques at the inner core boundary might also excite the Chandler wobble, provided there exists a physical mechanism that can generate a large torque at a 14 month period.","author":[{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Bloxham","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"DumberryBloxham2002","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-246X.2002.01756.x","ISSN":"0956540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"page":"377-392","title":"Inner core tilt and polar motion","type":"article-journal","volume":"151"},
  {"id":"DumberryBloxham2004","abstract":"We investigate whether a component of the flow in the Earth's fluid core, namely torsional oscillations, could be detected in gravity field data at the surface and whether it could explain some of the observed time variations in the elliptical part of the gravity field (J2). Torsional oscillations are azimuthal oscillations of rigid coaxial cylindrical surfaces and have typical periods of decades. This type of fluid motion supports geostrophic pressure gradients, which produce deformations of the core-mantle boundary. Because of the density discontinuity between the core and the mantle, such deformations produce changes in the gravity field that, because of the flow geometry, are both axisymmetric and symmetric about the equator. Torsional oscillations are thus expected to produce time variations in the zonal harmonics of even degree in the gravity field. Similarly, the changes in the rotation rates of the mantle and inner core that occur to balance the change in angular momentum carried by the torsional oscillations also produce zonal variations in gravity. We have built a model to calculate the changes in the gravity field and in the rotation rates of the mantle and inner core produced by torsional oscillations. We show that the changes in the rotation rate of the inner core produce changes in J2 that are a few orders of magnitude too small to be observed. The amplitudes of the changes in J2 from torsional oscillations are 10 times smaller than the temporal changes that are observed to occur about a linear secular trend. However, provided the mechanism responsible for these changes in J2 is identified and that this contribution is removed from the data, it may be possible in the future to detect the lowest harmonic degrees of the torsional oscillations in the gravity field data. We also show that torsional oscillations have contributed to the linear secular change in J2 by about −0.75 × 10−12 per year in the last 20 years. Finally, the associated change in the vertical ground motion at the surface of the Earth that is predicted by our mechanism is of the order of 0.2 mm, which is too small to be detected with the current precision in measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Bloxham","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"DumberryBloxham2004","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02402.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11,1]]},"page":"417-434","source":"Silverchair","title":"Variations in the Earth's gravity field caused by torsional oscillations in the core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02402.x","volume":"159"},
  {"id":"DumberryEtAl2013","abstract":"As Mercury orbits the Sun, gravitational torques on its ellipsoidal figure give rise to a longitudinal libration. Earth-based radar observations indicate that the outermost part of the core is fluid and only the mantle participates in the libration. If a solid inner core is present, it can alter the libration of the mantle through gravitational coupling. Previous studies have shown that the influence of the inner core on libration remains small, though not negligible if its radius is larger than 1000km. However, these studies considered a simplified model of the libration dynamics, where the density in both the inner core and fluid core were assumed uniform. Here, we build a model of Mercury’s libration that takes into account the radially varying density profile within the core. Our results indicate that the amplitude of the 88-day mantle libration is slightly larger than that predicted on the basis of the uniform density model, though the difference is well below the current error bars in observations. We also show that the period of the free libration of the combined inner core and mantle is largely unaffected by the details of the core density structure. However, the period of the second free mode of libration – broadly described by the gravitational oscillation between the mantle and inner core – is significantly longer when a more realistic core density profile is used. We discuss the implication of this result, and we also show how the role of the inner core can be taken into account when observations of gravity and rotation are combined to form constraints on the interior structure of Mercury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Rivoldini","given":"Attilio"},{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Yseboodt","given":"Marie"}],"citation-key":"DumberryEtAl2013","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2013.03.001","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"62-74","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The role of Mercury’s core density structure on its longitudinal librations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910351300095X","volume":"225"},
  {"id":"DumberryMandea2021","abstract":"Fluid motion within the Earth’s liquid outer core leads to internal mass redistribution. This occurs through the advection of density anomalies within the volume of the liquid core and by deformation of the solid boundaries of the mantle and inner core which feature density contrasts. It also occurs through torques acting on the inner core reorienting its non-spherical shape. These in situ mass changes lead to global gravity variations, and global deformations (inducing additional gravity variations) occur in order to maintain the mechanical equilibrium of the whole Earth. Changes in Earth’s rotation vector (and thus of the global centrifugal potential) induced by core flows are an additional source of global deformations and associated gravity changes originating from core dynamics. Here, we review how each of these different core processes operates, how gravity changes and ground deformations from each could be reconstructed, as well as ways to estimate their amplitudes. Based on our current understanding of core dynamics, we show that, at spherical harmonic degree 2, core processes contribute to gravity variations and ground deformations that are approximately a factor 10 smaller than those observed and caused by dynamical processes within the fluid layers at the Earth’s surface. The larger the harmonic degree, the smaller is the contribution from the core. Extracting a signal of core origin requires the accurate removal of all contributions from surface processes, which remains a challenge.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Mandea","given":"Mioara"}],"citation-key":"DumberryMandea2021","container-title":"Surveys in Geophysics","container-title-short":"Surv Geophys","DOI":"10.1007/s10712-021-09656-2","ISSN":"0169-3298, 1573-0956","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,30]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Gravity Variations and Ground Deformations Resulting from Core Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10712-021-09656-2"},

In particular, we focus on the case where the dependence on the eigenvalue is non-polynomial. Such problems arise in a variety of applications, some of which are portrayed in this work. Thanks to the linearity in the eigenvectors, the type of nonlinear eigenvalue problems under consideration exhibits a spectral structure which closely resembles that of a linear eigenvalue problem. Nevertheless, there also exist fundamental differences; for instance, a nonlinear eigenvalue problem can have infinitely many eigenvalues, and its eigenvectors may be linearly dependent. These issues render nonlinear eigenvalue problems much harder to solve than linear ones, and even though corresponding algorithms exist, their performance comes nowhere close to that of a modern linear eigensolver. Recently, minimal invariant pairs have been proposed as a numerically robust means of representing a portion of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem’s spectral structure. We compile the existing theory on this topic and develop this concept further. Other major theoretical contributions include a deflation technique for nonlinear eigenvalue problems, a first-order perturbation analysis for simple invariant pairs, as well as the characterization of the generic bifurcations of a real nonlinear eigenvalue problem depending on one real parameter. Based on these advances in theory, we propose and analyze several new algorithms for the solution of nonlinear eigenvalue problems, which improve on the properties of the existing solvers.

These basis functions have a rotational invariance not present in geophysical ﬂows. Gyroscopic alignment alignment of dynamics along the axis of rotation - is a hallmark of geophysical ﬂuids in the rapidly rotating regime. The Taylor-Proudman theorem, resulting from a dominant balance of the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, yields nearly invariant ﬂows along this axial direction. In this paper we tailor a coordinate system to the cylindrical structures found in rotating spherical ﬂows. This “spherindrical” coordinate system yields a natural hierarchy of basis functions, composed of Jacobi polynomials in the radial and vertical direction, regular throughout the ball. We expand ﬂuid variables using this basis and utilize sparse Jacobi polynomial algebra to implement all operators relevant for partial diﬀerential equations in the spherical setting. We demonstrate the representation power of the basis in three eigenvalue problems for rotating ﬂuids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ellison","given":"Abram C."},{"family":"Julien","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Vasil","given":"Geoffrey M."}],"citation-key":"EllisonEtAl2022","container-title":"Journal of Computational Physics","container-title-short":"Journal of Computational Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111170","ISSN":"00219991","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"111170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A gyroscopic polynomial basis in the sphere","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021999122002327"},

  {"id":"EnglandEtAl2007","abstract":"Many readers know the tale of how William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) calculated the age of the Earth from physical principles and adhered for over 50 years to an estimate that was far younger than geologists’ estimates, despite the virtually unanimous opposition of the geological community of the time. The prevalent version of this tale alleges that the discovery of radioactivity simultaneously provided the demonstration (through radiometric dating) that Kelvin had greatly underestimated the age of the Earth and the explanation of why he was wrong (radioactivity being a source of heat that invalidated Kelvin’s calculation). We show this popular story to be incorrect; introducing the known distribution of radioactivity into Kelvin’s calculation does not invalidate its conclusion. In 1895, before the discovery of radioactivity, John Perry showed that convection in the Earth’s interior would invalidate Kelvin’s estimate for the age of the Earth, but Perry’s analysis was neglected or forgotten, with the consequence that a powerful argument in favor of mobilism was overlooked during the first few decades of debate about continental drift.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"England","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Molnar","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"EnglandEtAl2007","container-title":"GSA Today","container-title-short":"Gsa Today","DOI":"10.1130/GSAT01701A.1","ISSN":"1052-5173","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"4","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics","title-short":"John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/17/1/pdf/i1052-5173-17-1-4.pdf","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"FalckeEtAl2000","abstract":"In recent years, evidence for the existence of an ultracompact concentration of dark mass associated with the radio source Sagittarius A* in the Galactic center has become very strong. However, unambiguous proof that this object is indeed a black hole is still lacking. A deﬁning characteristic of a black hole is the event horizon. To a distant observer, the event horizon casts a relatively large “shadow” with an apparent diameter of ∼10 gravitational radii that is due to the bending of light by the black hole, and this shadow is nearly independent of the black hole spin or orientation. The predicted size (∼30 mas) of this shadow for Sgr A* approaches the resolution of current radio interferometers. If the black hole is maximally spinning and viewed edge-on, then the shadow will be offset by ∼8 mas from the center of mass and will be slightly ﬂattened on one side. Taking into account the scatter broadening of the image in the interstellar medium and the ﬁnite achievable telescope resolution, we show that the shadow of Sgr A* may be observable with very long baseline interferometry at submillimeter wavelengths, assuming that the accretion ﬂow is optically thin in this region of the spectrum. Hence, there exists a realistic expectation of imaging the event horizon of a black hole within the next few years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Falcke","given":"Heino"},{"family":"Melia","given":"Fulvio"},{"family":"Agol","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"FalckeEtAl2000","container-title":"The Astrophysical Journal","DOI":"10.1086/312423","ISSN":"0004637X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"L13-L16","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Viewing the Shadow of the Black Hole at the Galactic Center","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/312423","volume":"528"},

  {"id":"FangLiao2019","abstract":"In response to the primary electric field originated by the fluid-core-dynamo, electric charges accumulate at the boundaries of a solid conducting D″ layer due to the poor circuitry conditions until the irrotational primary electric field is neutralized. The neutralization undoes the internal induction excited by the primary electric field and, as a result, eliminates the secondary toroidal magnetic field inside the D″. The primary magnetic field generated by the fluid-core-dynamo gives rise to a sustainable secondary poloidal magnetic field inside the conducting D″ layer. We introduce the general kinematic boundary conditions that are valid with different induction processes and parameter jumps across the core mantle boundary. We find by dimensional analysis that the strength of the secondary poloidal magnetic field is much weaker, by a factor of ∼10−2, than the irrotational primary. These findings indicate that the D″ is in effect an insulator for the geodynamo regardless of its material composition.

  {"id":"FavierEtAl2014","abstract":"We perform one of the first studies into the nonlinear evolution of tidally excited inertial waves in a uniformly rotating fluid body, exploring a simplified model of the fluid envelope of a planet (or the convective envelope of a solar-type star) subject to the gravitational tidal perturbations of an orbiting companion. Our model contains a perfectly rigid spherical core, which is surrounded by an envelope of incompressible uniform density fluid. The corresponding linear problem was studied in previous papers which this work extends into the nonlinear regime, at moderate Ekman numbers (the ratio of viscous to Coriolis accelerations). By performing high-resolution numerical simulations, using a combination of pseudo-spectral and spectral element methods, we investigate the effects of nonlinearities, which lead to time-dependence of the flow and the corresponding dissipation rate. Angular momentum is deposited non-uniformly, leading to the generation of significant differential rotation in the initially uniformly rotating fluid, i.e. the body does not evolve towards synchronism as a simple solid body rotator. This differential rotation modifies the properties of tidally excited inertial waves, changes the dissipative properties of the flow, and eventually becomes unstable to a secondary shear instability provided that the Ekman number is sufficiently small. Our main result is that the inclusion of nonlinearities eventually modifies the flow and the resulting dissipation from what linear calculations would predict, which has important implications for tidal dissipation in fluid bodies. We finally discuss some limitations of our simplified model, and propose avenues for future research to better understand the tidal evolution of rotating planets and stars.","author":[{"family":"Favier","given":"B."},{"family":"Barker","given":"A.

That knowledge has been ever necessary to carry out astronomical observations, but with the advent of the space age, it became essential for making observations of satellites and predicting and determining their orbits, and for observing the Earth from space as well. Given the relevant role it plays in Space Geodesy, Earth rotation is considered as one of the three pillars of Geodesy, the other two being geometry and gravity. Besides, research on Earth rotation has fostered advances in many fields, such as Mathematics, Astronomy and Geophysics, for centuries. One remarkable feature of the problem is in the extreme requirements of accuracy that must be fulfilled in the near future, about a millimetre on the tangent plane to the planet surface, roughly speaking. That challenges all of the theories that have been devised and used to-date; the paper makes a short review of some of the most relevant methods, which can be envisaged as milestones in Earth rotation research, emphasizing the Hamiltonian approach developed by the authors.

Although the wind field produces a large energy input to the ocean, all but approximately 10% appears to be dissipated within about 100 m of the sea surface, rendering observations of the energy divergence necessary to maintain the full water-column flow difficult. Attention thus shifts to the physically different kinetic energy (KE) reservoirs of the circulation and their maintenance, dissipation, and possible influence on the very small scales representing irreversible molecular mixing. Oceanic KE is dominated by the geostrophic eddy field, and depending on the vertical structure (barotropic versus low-mode baroclinic), direct and inverse energy cascades are possible. The pathways toward dissipation of the dominant geostrophic eddy KE depend crucially on the direction of the cascade but are difficult to quantify because of serious observational difficulties for wavelengths shorter than approximately 100–200 km. At high frequencies, KE is dominated by internal waves with near-inertial frequencies (frequencies near the local Coriolis parameter), whose shears appear to be a major source of wave breaking and mixing in the ocean interior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Raffaele"},{"family":"Wunsch","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"FerrariWunsch2009","container-title":"Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.fluid.40.111406.102139","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"253-282","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Ocean Circulation Kinetic Energy: Reservoirs, Sources, and Sinks","title-short":"Ocean Circulation Kinetic Energy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.fluid.40.111406.102139","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"FullerEtAl2014","abstract":"Recent observations have revealed evidence for the global acoustic oscillations of Jupiter and Saturn. Such oscillations can potentially provide a new window into the interior structure of giant planets. Motivated by these observations, we study the non-radial oscillation modes of giant planets containing a solid core. Our calculations include the elastic response of the core and consider a wide range of possible values of the core shear modulus. While the elasticity of the core only slightly changes the frequencies of acoustic modes (including the f-modes), which reside mostly in the fluid envelope, it adds two new classes of shear modes that are largely confined to the core. We also calculate the effects of the Coriolis force on the planetary oscillation modes. In addition to changing the mode frequencies, the Coriolis force can cause the shear modes to mix with the f-modes. Such mixing occurs when the frequencies of the shear mode and the f-mode are close to each other, and results in \"mixed modes\" that have similarly large surface displacements and gravitational potential perturbations, but are slightly split in frequency. We discuss our results in light of the recent work by Hedman and Nicholson (Hedman, M., Nicholson, P. [2013]. arXiv:1304.3735), which revealed the presence of density waves in Saturn's C-ring that appear to be excited by the gravitational perturbations associated with the f-mode oscillations within Saturn. We find that the fine splitting in wave frequencies observed in the rings can in principle be explained by the rotation-induced mixing between core shear modes and f-modes, possibly indicating the presence of a solid core within Saturn. However, in our current calculations, which assume rigid-body rotation and include only first-order rotational effects, significant fine-tuning in the planetary model parameters is needed in order to achieve these mode mixings and to explain the observed fine frequency splitting.

  {"id":"FullerEtAl2016","abstract":"The inner moons of Jupiter and Saturn migrate outwards due to tidal energy dissipation within the planets, the details of which remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that resonance locking between moons and internal oscillation modes of the planet can produce rapid tidal migration. Resonance locking arises due to the internal structural evolution of the planet and typically produces an outward migration rate comparable to the age of the solar system. Resonance locking predicts a similar migration timescale but a different effective tidal quality factor $Q$ governing the migration of each moon. It also predicts nearly constant migration timescales a function of semi-major axis, such that effective $Q$ values were larger in the past. Recent measurements of Jupiter and Saturn's moon systems find effective $Q$ values that are smaller than expected (and are different between moons), and which correspond to migration timescales of $\\sim$10 Gyr. If confirmed, the measurements are broadly consistent with resonance locking as the dominant source of tidal dissipation in Jupiter and Saturn. Resonance locking also provides solutions to several problems posed by current measurements: it naturally explains the exceptionally small $Q$ governing Rhea's migration, it allows the large heating rate of Enceladus to be achieved in an equilibrium eccentricity configuration, and it resolves evolutionary problems arising from present-day migration/heating rates.","author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"Jim"},{"family":"Luan","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Quataert","given":"Eliot"}],"citation-key":"FullerEtAl2016","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/stw609","ISSN":"13652966","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"3867-3879","title":"Resonance locking as the source of rapid tidal migration in the Jupiter and Saturn moon systems","type":"article-journal","volume":"458"},

Not only do tides affect the pre-merger state (such as temperature and rotation rate) of the WDs, but they may also determine which systems merge and which undergo stable mass transfer. In this paper, we attempt to quantify the effects of rotation on tidal angular momentum transport in binary stars, with speciﬁc calculations applied to WD stellar models. We incorporate the effect of rotation using the traditional approximation, in which the dynamically excited gravity waves within the WDs are transformed into gravitoinertial Hough waves. The Coriolis force has only a minor effect on prograde gravity waves, and previous results predicting the tidal spin-up and heating of inspiraling WDs are not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed. However, rotation strongly alters retrograde gravity waves and inertial waves, with important consequences for the tidal spin-down of accreting WDs. We identify new dynamical tidal forcing terms that arise from a proper separation of the equilibrium and dynamical tide components; these new forcing terms are very important for systems near synchronous rotation. Additionally, we discuss the impact of Stokes drift currents on the wave angular momentum ﬂux. Finally, we speculate on how tidal interactions will affect supersynchronously rotating WDs in accreting systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Fuller","given":"Jim"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Dong"}],"citation-key":"FullerLai2014","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/stu1698","ISSN":"1365-2966, 0035-8711","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,11]]},"language":"en","page":"3488-3500","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Dynamical tides in compact white dwarf binaries: influence of rotation","title-short":"Dynamical tides in compact white dwarf binaries","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/444/4/3488/1026717/Dynamical-tides-in-compact-white-dwarf-binaries","volume":"444"},

  {"id":"GastineEtAl2016","abstract":"Rayleigh-Bénard convection in rotating spherical shells can be considered as a simplified analogue of many astrophysical and geophysical fluid flows. Here, we use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations to study this physical process. We construct a dataset of more than 200 numerical models that cover a broad parameter range with Ekman numbers spanning 3 × 10-7 ≤ E ≤ 10-1, Rayleigh numbers within the range 103<Ra ≤ 2 × 1010 and a Prandtl number of unity. The radius ratio is 0.6 in all cases and gravity is assumed to be proportional to . We investigate the scaling behaviours of both local (length scales, boundary layers) and global (Nusselt and Reynolds numbers) properties across various physical regimes from onset of rotating convection to weakly rotating convection. Close to critical, the convective flow is dominated by a triple force balance between viscosity, Coriolis force and buoyancy. For larger supercriticalities, a small subset of our numerical data approach the asymptotic diffusivity-free scaling of rotating convection Nu ∼ Ra3/2E2 in a narrow fraction of the parameter space delimited by 6 Rac ≤ Ra ≤ 0.4 E-8/5. Using a decomposition of the viscous dissipation rate into bulk and boundary layer contributions, we establish a theoretical scaling of the flow velocity that accurately describes the numerical data. In rapidly rotating turbulent convection, the fluid bulk is controlled by a triple force balance between Coriolis, inertia and buoyancy, while the remaining fraction of the dissipation can be attributed to the viscous friction in the Ekman layers. Beyond Ra ≃ E-8/5, the rotational constraint on the convective flow is gradually lost and the flow properties continuously vary to match the regime changes between rotation-dominated and non-rotating convection.

  {"id":"Gerick2020","abstract":"Earth’s magnetic field and rotation rate change on periods of several years. In this thesis it is investigated if and how such changes can be caused by modes (standing waves) in the liquid and conducting core. To do so, a model for a rapidly rotating and electrically conducting planetary core is developed that is able to handle non-idealized magnetic fields and a non-spherical boundary. We exploit the rapid rotation of the fluid to simplify our model, using the so-called quasi-geostrophic assumption, where the horizontal components of the velocity become invariant along the axis of rotation. By deriving such a model in a non-axisymmetric geometry, we are able to investigate the pressure torque exerted onto the core-mantle boundary by modes, which are linear solutions to the model. So-called torsional Alfvén modes are of particular interest, as they consist of differentially rotating geostrophic cylinders, potentially carrying axial angular momentum. These cylinders act against the tension of sheared radial magnetic field lines, showing their Alfvénic nature. In Earth’s core they are assumed to have periods of a few years, and they have been correlated to changes in the length of day on periods of about six years. Our results suggest that the pressure torque associated with such torsional Alfvén modes is inefficient to explain the observed changes in Earth’s length of day. It is found that the amplitude of the pressure associated with these modes should be inde- pendent of the rotation rate, if the volume does not allow for non-closed geostrophic contours. It needs to be investigated if the pressure torque can be increased by con- sidering more complex geometries than the ellipsoid, investigated here. Otherwise, torsional Alfvén modes in the core must be coupled to an electrically conducting layer in the lowermost mantle or by a gravitational torque to explain the observed changes in the length of day. In a second part we investigated Magneto-Coriolis modes in a homogeneous spherical core model, where we can describe the magnetic field in such a way that magnetic field changes on the core surface do not vanish. Geomagnetic observations reveal changes of Earth’s magnetic field on various time scales, ranging from several millions of years to inter-annual changes. Projecting the observations through the mantle, inter-annual changes of the magnetic field on the core surface are accounted for by flows in the liquid outer core. In our model we calculate Magneto-Coriolis modes of periods of several years. These fast Magneto-Coriolis modes show strong focusing of their kinetic and magnetic en- ergy in the equatorial region, while maintaining a relatively large spatial structure along the azimuthal direction. Their properties agree with some observations and inferred core flows. We find additionally, in contrast to what has been assumed pre- viously, that these modes are not affected significantly by magnetic diffusion. The new model opens a new way of inverting geomagnetic observations to the flow and magnetic field deep within the Earth’s outer core. i","author":[{"family":"Gerick","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"Gerick2020","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"UNIVERSITÉ GRENOBLE ALPES","title":"Fast Magneto-Coriolis Modes and Pressure Torques arising from Torsional Alfvén Modes in Planetary Cores","type":"thesis"},

We use this model to investigate and quantify the axial torques of linear modes, focusing on the torsional Alfvén modes (TM) in an ellipsoid. We verify that the periods of these modes do not depend on the rotation frequency. Furthermore, they possess angular momentum resulting in a net pressure torque acting on the mantle.

  {"id":"Gillet2010","abstract":"The magnetic field inside the Earth's fluid and electrically conducting outer core cannot be directly probed. The root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) intensity for the resolved part of the radial magnetic field at the core-mantle boundary is 0.3 mT, but further assumptions are needed to infer the strength of the field inside the core. Recent diagnostics obtained from numerical geodynamo models indicate that the magnitude of the dipole field at the surface of a fluid dynamo is about ten times weaker than the r.m.s. field strength in its interior, which would yield an intensity of the order of several millitesla within the Earthĝ€ ™s core. However, a 60-year signal found in the variation in the length of day has long been associated with magneto-hydrodynamic torsional waves carried by a much weaker internal field. According to these studies, the r.m.s. strength of the field in the cylindrical radial direction (calculated for all length scales) is only 0.2 mT, a figure even smaller than the r.m.s. strength of the large-scale (spherical harmonic degree n ≥13) field visible at the core-mantle boundary. Here we reconcile numerical geodynamo models with studies of geostrophic motions in the Earthg-s core that rely on geomagnetic data. From an ensemble inversion of core flow models, we find a torsional wave recurring every six years, the angular momentum of which accounts well for both the phase and the amplitude of the six-year signal for change in length of day detected over the second half of the twentieth century. It takes about four years for the wave to propagate throughout the fluid outer core, and this travel time translates into a slowness for Alfv waves that corresponds to a r.m.s. field strength in the cylindrical radial direction of approximately 2 mT. Assuming isotropy, this yields a r.m.s. field strength of 4 mT inside the Earth-s core.","author":[{"family":"Gillet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Jault","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Canet","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Alexandre"}],"citation-key":"Gillet2010","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature09010","ISSN":"00280836","issue":"7294","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"74-77","title":"Fast torsional waves and strong magnetic field within the Earth's core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09010","volume":"465"},

Inverting recursively for an ensemble of solutions, we evaluate the main source of uncertainties, namely, the model errors arising from interactions between unresolved core surface motions and magnetic fields. Temporal correlations of these uncertainties are accounted for. The covariance matrix for the flow coefficients is also obtained recursively from the dispersion of an ensemble of solutions. Maps of the flow at the core surface show, upon a planetary-scale gyre, time-dependent large-scale eddies at midlatitudes, and vigorous azimuthal jets in the equatorial belt. The stationary part of the flow predominates on all the spatial scales that we can resolve. We retrieve torsional waves that explain the length-of-day changes at 4 to 9.5 years periods. These waves may be triggered by the nonlinear interaction between the magnetic field and subdecadal nonzonal motions within the fluid outer core. Both the zonal and the more energetic nonzonal interannual motions were particularly intense close to the equator (below 10∘ latitude) between 1995 and 2010.

We discuss to what extent the emergence of free torsional modes from a stochastic forcing in the fluid core is compatible with some dissipation, specifically with an electromagnetic torque strong enough to account for the observed length of day variations of 6 yr period. In a spherical cavity enclosed by an insulating mantle, torsional normal modes consist of standing waves. In the presence of a conducting mantle, they transform into outward travelling waves very similar to the torsional waves that have been detected in the Earth’s outer core. With such a resonant response a periodic forcing is not required to explain the regular recurrence of torsional waves; neither is the search for a source of motions in the vicinity of the cylindrical surface tangent to the inner core, where travelling waves seem to emerge. We discuss these results in the light of the reflection properties of torsional waves at the equator. We are able to reproduce the properties found for geophysical time-series of geostrophic flows (detection of a normal mode, almost total absorption at the equator) if the conductance of the lowermost mantle is 3 × 107 to 108 S.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gillet","given":"N."},{"family":"Jault","given":"D."},{"family":"Canet","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"GilletEtAl2017","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggx237","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"page":"1503-1516","source":"Silverchair","title":"Excitation of travelling torsional normal modes in an Earth’s core model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx237","volume":"210"},
  {"id":"GilletEtAl2020","abstract":"Planetary scale interannual deformations of the Earth’s surface, of millimetric amplitude, have recently been related to both geomagnetic ﬁeld changes and motion within the ﬂuid outer core. We calculate the temporal variations of the dynamical pressure at the surface of the core associated with core ﬂow models inverted from geomagnetic observations. From these we compute predictions of the changes in Earth’s topography in response to elastic deformations in the mantle. We show that at decadal periods, the predicted changes in Earth’s topography are at most of the order of 0.3 mm. Focused at interannual periods between 4 and 9.5 yr, the predicted topography variations are smaller than 0.05 mm, at least an order of magnitude smaller than the reported observations. These amplitudes are only weakly sensitive to the choice of hypothesis used to reconstruct ﬂuid motions at the core surface. We conclude that surface deformations induced by dynamical pressure changes in the core are below the detection level at present-day. Alternative geophysical sources must be sought to explain the observed millimetric interannual variations of the planetary scale topography, and its associated gravity variations. We currently see no justiﬁcation for a physical relationship between interannual ﬂuctuations of the geomagnetic ﬁeld and of Earth’s observed deformations. We conjecture that the largest gravity signal of core origin is potentially associated with decadal longitudinal oscillations of the inner core.

However, as the implicit assumptions underlying it are not as well understood as they ought to be, we examine the traditional approximation and discuss the associated mode solutions. The results demonstrate that, while the approximation may be appropriate in certain contexts, it may not be accurate for rapidly rotating neutron stars.

  {"id":"GlaneBuffett2018","abstract":"Fluctuations in the length of day (LOD) over periods of several decades are commonly attributed to exchanges of angular momentum between the mantle and the core. However, the forces that enable this exchange are less certain. Suggestions include the inﬂuence of pressure on boundary topography, electromagnetic forces associated with conducting material in the boundary region and gravitational forces due to mass anomalies in the mantle and the core. Each of these suggestions has strengths and weaknesses. Here we propose a new coupling mechanism that relies on the presence of stable stratiﬁcation at the top of the core. Steady ﬂow of the core over boundary topography promotes radial motion, but buoyancy forces due to stratiﬁcation oppose this motion. Steep vertical gradients develop in the resulting ﬂuid velocity, causing horizontal electromagnetic forces in the presence of a radial magnetic ﬁeld. The associated pressure ﬁeld exerts a net horizontal force on the boundary. We quantify this hybrid mechanism using a local Cartesian approximation of the core-mantle boundary and show that the resulting stresses are sufﬁcient to account for the observed changes in LOD. A representative solution has 52 m of topography with a wavelength of 100 km. We specify the ﬂuid stratiﬁcation using a buoyancy frequency that is comparable to the rotation rate and adopt a radial magnetic ﬁeld based on geodetic constraints. The average tangential stress is 0.027 N m−2 for a background ﬂow of V¯ = 0.5 mm s−1. Weak variations in the stress with velocity (i.e. V¯ 1/2) introduce nonlinearities into the angular momentum balance, which may generate diagnostic features in LOD observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Glane","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"GlaneBuffett2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"GotoEtAl2014","abstract":"Motivated by the fascinating fact that strong turbulence can be sustained in a weakly precessing container, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments on the flow in a precessing spherical cavity, and in a slightly elongated prolate spheroidal cavity with a minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.9. In order to determine the conditions required to sustain turbulence in these cavities, and to investigate the statistics of the sustained turbulence, we developed an experimental technique to conduct high-quality flow visualizations as well as measurements via particle image velocimetry on a turntable and by using an intense laser. In general, flows in a precessing cavity are controlled by two non-dimensional parameters: the Reynolds number Re (or its reciprocal, the Ekman number) which is defined by the cavity size, spin angular velocity, and the kinematic viscosity of the confined fluid, and the Poincaré number Po, which is defined by the ratio of the magnitude of the precession angular velocity to that of the spin angular velocity. However, our experiments show that the global flow statistics, such as the mean velocity field and the spatial distribution of the intensity of the turbulence, are almost independent of Re, and they are determined predominantly by Po, whereas the instability of these global flow structures is governed by Re. It is also shown that the turbulence statistics are most likely similar in the two cavities due to the slight difference between their shapes. However, the condition to sustain the unsteady flows, and therefore the turbulence, differs drastically depending on the cavity shape. Interestingly, the asymmetric cavity, i.e., the spheroid, requires a much stronger precession than a sphere to sustain such unsteady flows. The most developed turbulence for a given Re is generated in these cavities when 0.04 ≲ Po ≲ 0.1. In such cases, the sustained turbulence is always accompanied by vigorous large-scale vortical structures, and shearing motions around these large-scale vortices create smaller-scale turbulent vortices. The spatial average of the Taylor-length based Reynolds number of the turbulence in the precessing sphere is about 0.15 R e for Po = 0.1.","author":[{"family":"Goto","given":"Susumu"},{"family":"Matsunaga","given":"Arihiro"},{"family":"Fujiwara","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Nishioka","given":"Michio"},{"family":"Kida","given":"Shigeo"},{"family":"Yamato","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Tsuda","given":"Shinya"}],"citation-key":"GotoEtAl2014","container-title":"Physics of Fluids","DOI":"10.1063/1.4874695","ISSN":"10897666","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"title":"Turbulence driven by precession in spherical and slightly elongated spheroidal cavities","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"GrannanEtAl2017","abstract":"The turbulence generated in the liquid metal cores and subsurface oceans of planetary bodies may be due to the role of mechanical forcing through precession/nutation, libration, tidal forcing and collisions. Here, we model the response of an enclosed constant density fluid to tidal forcing by combining laboratory equatorial velocity measurements with selected highresolution numerical simulations to show, for the first time, the generation of bulk filling turbulence. The transition to saturated turbulence is characterized by an elliptical instability that first excites primary inertial modes of the system, then secondary inertial modes forced by the primary inertial modes, and then bulk filling turbulence. The amplitude of this saturated turbulence scales with the body's elliptical distortion, U ~ β, while a time- and radially averaged azimuthal zonal flow scales with β2. The results of the current tidal experiments are compared with recent studies of the libration-driven turbulent flows studied by Grannan et al. and Favier et al. Tides and libration correspond to two end-member types of geophysical mechanical forcings. For satellites dominated by tidal forcing, the ellipsoidal boundary enclosing the internal fluid layers is elastically deformed while, for librational forcing, the core-mantle boundary possesses an inherently rigid, frozen-in ellipsoidal shape.We find striking similarities between tidally and librationally driven flow transitions to bulk turbulence and zonal flows. This suggests a generic fluid response independent of the style of mechanical forcing. Since β ≲ 10-4 in planetary bodies, it is often argued that mechanically driven zonal velocities will be small. In contrast, our linear scaling for mechanically driven bulk turbulence, U ~ β, suggests geophysically significant velocities that can play a significant role in planetary processes including tidal dissipation and magnetic field generation.","author":[{"family":"Grannan","given":"A.

  {"id":"GreenwoodEtAl2021","abstract":"Stable stratification at the top of the Earth’s outer core has been suggested based upon seismic and geomagnetic observations, however, the origin of the layer is still unknown. In this paper we focus on a thermal origin for the layer and conduct a systematic study on the thermal evolution of the core. We develop a new numerical code to model the growth of thermally stable layers beneath the CMB, integrated into a thermodynamic model for the long term evolution of the core. We conduct a systematic study on plausible thermal histories using a range of core properties and, combining thickness and stratification strength constraints, investigate the limits upon the present day structure of the thermal layer. We find that whilst there are a number of scenarios for the history of the CMB heat flow, Qc, that give rise to thermal stratification, many of them are inconsistent with previously published exponential trends in Qc from mantle evolution models. Layers formed due to an exponentially decaying Qc are limited to 250–400 km thick and have maximum present-day Brunt-Va¨isa¨la¨ periods, TBV = 8 − 24 hrs. When entrainment of the lowermost region of the layer is included in our model, the upper limit of the layer size is reduced and can fully inhibit the growth of any layer if our non-dimensional measure of entrainment, E > 0.2. The period TBV is insensitive to the evolution and so our estimates remain distinct from estimates arising from a chemical origin. Therefore, TBV should be able to discern between thermal and chemical mechanisms as improved seismic constraints are obtained.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Greenwood","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Mound","given":"Jon E."}],"citation-key":"GreenwoodEtAl2021","container-title":"Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors","container-title-short":"Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors","DOI":"10.1016/j.pepi.2021.106763","ISSN":"00319201","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"en","page":"106763","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the evolution of thermally stratified layers at the top of Earth's core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031920121001217","volume":"318"},

This pressure field changes at a decadal time scale and may be estimated from observations of the surface magnetic field and its secular variation. First, using a spherical harmonic expansion, the poloidal and toroidal part of the fluid velocity field at the CMB for the last 40 years is computed, under the hypothesis of tangential geostrophy. Then the associated geostrophic pressure, whose order of magnitude is about 1000 Pa, is computed. The surface topography induced by this pressure field is computed using Love numbers, and is a few millimetres. The mass redistribution gravitational potential induced by these deformations and, in particular, the zonal components of the related surface gravitational potential perturbation (ΔJ2, ΔJ3 and ΔJ4 coefficients), are calculated. Overall perturbations for the J2 coefficient of about 10−10, for J3 of about 10−11 and for J4 are found of about 0.3×10−11. Finally, these theoretical results are compared with recent observations of the decadal variation of J2 from satellite laser ranging. Results concerning ΔJ2 can be described as follows: first, they are one order of magnitude too small to explain the observed decadal variation of J2 and, second, they show a significant linear trend over the last 40 years, whose rate of decrease amounts to 7% of the observed value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Greff-Lefftz","given":"M."},{"family":"Pais","given":"M.

This global displacement field rearranges the Earth’s mass thereby causing the Earth’s rotation and gravitational field to change. The size of this change depends upon the magnitude, focal mechanism, and location of the earthquake. The Sumatran earthquake of December 26, 2004 is the largest earthquake to have occurred since the 1960 Chilean earthquake. Using a spherical, layered Earth model, the coseismic effect of the Sumatran earthquake upon the Earth’s length-of-day, polar motion, and low-degree harmonic coefficients of the gravitational field are computed. Using a model of the earthquake source that is composed of five subevents having a total moment-magnitude Mwof 9.3, it is found that this earthquake should have caused the length-of-day to decrease by 6.8 microseconds, the position of the Earth’s generalized figure axis to shift 2.32 milliarcseconds towards 127° E longitude, the Earth’s oblateness J2 to decrease by 2.37 × 10−11 and the Earth’s pear-shapedness J3 to decrease by 0.63 × 10−11.

The solid Earth responds to these forces by displacing its mass, deforming its shape, and changing its rotation. Geodetic observing systems can measure the change in the Earth's gravity caused by mass displacement, the change in the Earth's shape, and the change in the Earth's rotation. Consequently, geodetic observing systems can be used to study both the mechanisms causing the Earth's shape, rotation, and gravity to change and the response of the solid Earth to these forcing mechanisms. As a result, geodetic observing systems can be used to gain greater understanding of the Earth's interior structure and of the nature of the forcing mechanisms including their temporal evolution. In this chapter, the variations in the Earth's rotation that occur on timescales greater than a day are discussed.

The dissipation of these waves plays a prominent role in the long-term orbital and rotational evolution of the bodies involved. If the primary star rotates as a solid body, inertial waves have a Doppler-shifted frequency restricted to the range $[-2\\Omega, 2\\Omega]$ ($\\Omega$ being the angular velocity of the star), and they can propagate in the entire convective region. However, turbulent convection can sustain differential rotation with an equatorial acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration that modifies the frequency range and propagation domain of inertial waves and allows corotation resonances for non-axisymmetric oscillations. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of tidally excited inertial waves in a differentially rotating convective envelope with a conical (or latitudinal) rotation profile. The tidal forcing that we adopt contains spherical harmonics that correspond to the case of a circular and coplanar orbit. We study the viscous dissipation of the waves as a function of tidal frequency for various stellar masses and differential rotation parameters, as well as its dependence on the turbulent viscosity coefficient. We compare our results with previous studies assuming solid-body rotation and point out the potential key role of corotation resonances in the dynamical evolution of close-in star-planet or binary systems.","author":[{"family":"Guenel","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Mathis","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Baruteau","given":"Clément"},{"family":"Rieutord","given":"Michel"}],"citation-key":"GuenelEtAl2016","DOI":"10.1051/0004-6361/201527621","ISSN":"0004-6361","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"1-17","title":"Tidal dissipation by inertial waves in differentially rotating convective envelopes of low-mass stars","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05071","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"Guervilly2022","abstract":"Stably-stratiﬁed layers may be present at the top of the electrically-conducting ﬂuid layers of many planets either because the temperature gradient is locally subadiabatic or because a stable composition gradient is maintained by the segregation of chemical elements. Here we study the double-diﬀusive processes taking place in such a stable layer, considering the case of Mercury’s core where the temperature gradient is stable but the composition gradient is unstable over a 800km-thick layer. The large diﬀerence in the molecular diﬀusivities leads to the development of buoyancy-driven instabilities that drive radial ﬂows known as ﬁngering convection. We model ﬁngering convection using hydrodynamical simulations in a rotating spherical shell and varying the rotation rate and the stratiﬁcation strength. For small Rayleigh numbers (i.e. weak background temperature and composition gradients), ﬁngering convection takes the form of columnar ﬂows aligned with the rotation axis and with an azimuthal size comparable with the layer thickness. For larger Rayleigh numbers, the ﬂows retain a columnar structure but the azimuthal size is drastically reduced leading to thin sheet-like structures that are elongated in the meridional direction. The azimuthal size decreases when the thermal stratiﬁcation increases, following closely the scaling law expected from the linear planar theory (Stern, 1960). We ﬁnd that the radial ﬂows always remain laminar with local Reynolds number of order 1 − 10. Equatorially-symmetric zonal ﬂows form due to latitudinal variations of the axisymmetric composition. The zonal velocity exceeds the non-axisymmetric velocities at the largest Rayleigh numbers.

  {"id":"GuervillyEtAl2013","abstract":"We present a numerical study of dynamo action in a conducting ﬂuid encased in a metallic spherical shell. Motions in the ﬂuid are driven by diﬀerential rotation of the outer metallic shell, which we refer to as “the wall”. The two hemispheres of the wall are held in counter-rotation, producing a steady, axisymmetric interior ﬂow consisting of diﬀerential rotation and a two-cell meridional circulation with radial inﬂow in the equatorial plane. From previous studies, this type of ﬂow is known to maintain a stationary equatorial dipole by dynamo action if the magnetic Reynolds number is larger than about 300 and if the outer boundary is electrically insulating. We vary independently the thickness, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability of the wall to determine their eﬀect on the dynamo action. The main results are: (a) Increasing the conductivity of the wall hinders the dynamo by allowing eddy currents within the wall, which are induced by the relative motion of the equatorial dipole ﬁeld and the wall. This processes can be viewed as a skin eﬀect or, equivalently, as the tearing apart of the dipole by the diﬀerential rotation of the wall, to which the ﬁeld lines are anchored by high conductivity. (b) Increasing the magnetic permeability of the wall favors dynamo action by constraining the magnetic ﬁeld lines in the ﬂuid to be normal to the wall, thereby decoupling the ﬂuid from any induction in the wall. (c) Decreasing the wall thickness limits the amplitude of the eddy currents, and is therefore favorable for dynamo action, provided that the wall is thinner than the skin depth.

We can infer that they are all enriched in heavy elements compared to the Sun, with the relative global enrichments increasing with distance to the Sun. We can also infer that they possess dense cores of varied masses. The intercomparison of presently characterized extrasolar giant planets shows that they are also mainly made of hydrogen and helium, but that they either have significantly different amounts of heavy elements, have had different orbital evolutions, or both.

The discovery by the Juno spacecraft that Jupiter’s gravity field is north–south asymmetric5 and the determination of its non-zero odd gravitational harmonics J3, J5, J7 and J9 demonstrates that the observed zonal cloud flow must persist to a depth of about 3,000 kilometres from the cloud tops6. Here we report an analysis of Jupiter’s even gravitational harmonics J4, J6, J8 and J10 as observed by Juno5 and compared to the predictions of interior models. We find that the deep interior of the planet rotates nearly as a rigid body, with differential rotation decreasing by at least an order of magnitude compared to the atmosphere. Moreover, we find that the atmospheric zonal flow extends to more than 2,000 kilometres and to less than 3,500 kilometres, making it fully consistent with the constraints obtained independently from the odd gravitational harmonics. This depth corresponds to the point at which the electric conductivity becomes large and magnetic drag should suppress differential rotation7. Given that electric conductivity is dependent on planetary mass, we expect the outer, differentially rotating region to be at least three times deeper in Saturn and to be shallower in massive giant planets and brown dwarfs.","author":[{"family":"Guillot","given":"T."},{"family":"Miguel","given":"Y."},{"family":"Militzer","given":"B."},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"W.

With this formulation, using the eigenvalue method, we solved four rotational normal modes, including the Chandler Wobble (CW), Free Core Nutation (FCN), Free Inner Core Nutation (FICN), and the Inner Core Wobble (ICW). The triaxiality of the actual Earth has notable effects on rotational normal modes, that is, 0.005, 0.0, (Formula presented.) 0.071, and 1.174 d (mean solar days), respectively, for the CW, FCN, FICN, and ICW.

  {"id":"Harlander2007","abstract":"Linear internal waves in inviscid bounded fluids generally give a mathematically ill-posed problem since hyperbolic equations are combined with elliptic boundary conditions. Such problems are difficult to solve. Two new approaches are added to the existing methods: the first solves the two-dimensional spatial wave equation by iteratively adjusting Cauchy data such that boundary conditions are satisfied along a predefined boundary. After specifying the data in this way, solutions can be computed using the d'Alembert formula. The second new approach can numerically solve a wider class of two dimensional linear hyperbolic boundary value problems by using a 'boundary collocation' technique. This method gives solutions in the form of a partial sum of analytic functions that are, from a practical point of view, more easy to handle than solutions obtained from characteristics. Collocation points have to be prescribed along certain segments of the boundary but also in the so-called fundamental intervals, regions along the boundary where Cauchy data can be given arbitrarily without over-or under-determining the problem. Three prototypical hyperbolic boundary value problems are solved with this method: the Poincaré, the Telegraph, and the Tricomi boundary value problem. All solutions show boundary-detached internal shear layers, typical for hyperbolic boundary value problems. For the Tricomi problem it is found that the matrix that has to be inverted to find solutions from the collocation approach is ill-conditioned; thus solutions depend on the distribution of the collocation points and need to be regularized. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.","author":[{"family":"Harlander","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Maas","given":"Leo R.M."}],"citation-key":"Harlander2007","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/S0022112007007574","ISSN":"00221120","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"331-351","title":"Two alternatives for solving hyperbolic boundary value problems of geophysical fluid dynamics","type":"article-journal","volume":"588"},

Our analysis accounts for the centrifugal deformation of the star, and considers the two-fluid dynamics at linear order in the perturbed velocities. Our main focus is on a simple model system where the total density profile is that of an n= 1 polytrope. We derive a partially analytic solution for the superfluid analogue of the classical r mode. This solution is used to analyse the relevance of the vortex-mediated mutual friction damping, confirming that this dissipation mechanism is unlikely to suppress the gravitational-wave-driven instability in rapidly spinning superfluid neutron stars. Our calculation of the superfluid r modes is significantly simpler than previous approaches, because it decouples the r mode from all other inertial modes of the system. This leads to the results being clearer, but it also means that we cannot comment on the relevance of potential avoided crossings (and associated 'resonances') that may occur for particular parameter values. Our analysis of the mutual friction damping differs from previous studies in two important ways. First, we incorporate realistic pairing gaps which means that the regions of superfluidity in the star's core vary with temperature. Secondly, we allow the mutual friction parameters to take the whole range of permissible values rather than focusing on a particular mechanism. Thus, we consider not only the weak drag regime, but also the strong drag regime where the fluid dynamics are significantly different.","author":[{"family":"Haskell","given":"B."},{"family":"Andersson","given":"N."},{"family":"Passamonti","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"HaskellEtAl2009","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.14963.x","ISSN":"00358711","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"page":"1464-1485","title":"R modes and mutual friction in rapidly rotating superfluid neutron stars","type":"article-journal","volume":"397"},

We develop a numerical finite difference model to solve the Laplace Tidal Equations on a sphere in order to simulate tidal flow and thermal energy dissipation in these oceans, neglecting the presence of an icy lid. The model is applied to Titan and Enceladus, where we explore how Rayleigh (linear) and bottom (quadratic) drag terms affect dissipation. The latter drag regime can only be applied numerically. We find excellent agreement between our results and recent analytical work. Obliquity tide Rossby-wave resonant features become independent of ocean thickness under the bottom drag regime for thick oceans. We show that for Titan, dissipation from this Rossby-wave resonance can act to dampen the rate of outward orbital migration by up to 40% for Earth-like values of bottom drag coefficient. Gravity-wave resonances can act to cause inward migration, although this is unlikely due to the thin oceans required to form such resonances.

  {"id":"Hay2019","abstract":"Subsurface ocean tides act as a mechanism to dissipate tidal energy in icy satellite interiors. We numerically model the effect of an ice shell on ocean tides using non-linear bottom drag for the first time. We demonstrate that subsurface oceans experience tidal pressurization due to the confining nature of the ice shell, and find that Enceladus’ eccentricity forcing can generate up to 2.2 kPa of pressure excess at the ocean surface. Existing free-surface oceanic energy dissipation scaling laws are extended to subsurface oceans, and are benchmarked against our numerical results to within 10 %. We show that for the large bodies Ganymede, Europa and Titan, an ice shell increases eccentricity tidal heating due to self-gravity, whereas the shell's suppressive mechanical forcing reduces eccentricity tide dissipation on Enceladus and Dione by several orders of magnitude due to their high effective rigidities. In contrast, the ice shell enhances obliquity-forced dissipation in all satellites investigated, except Triton, because the largely divergence-free ocean response is unaffected by the shell's rigidity but is still enhanced by self-gravity. We conclude that the fundamental difference in ocean response to obliquity and eccentricity forcing, combined with self-gravity, results in increased obliquity heating and suppressed eccentricity heating in small satellites. For large satellites with low effective rigidities, the type of ocean response is less important because the shell's mechanical forcing has little impact on the flow, whereas self-gravity will enhance the response, and consequently dissipation, regardless of the forcing. Overall, obliquity tides are likely to dominate the tidal heating budget of icy satellite oceans, remaining the most prominent source of fluid dissipation in subsurface barotropic ocean tides.","author":[{"family":"Hay","given":"Hamish C.F.C."},{"family":"Matsuyama","given":"Isamu"}],"citation-key":"Hay2019","container-title":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2018.09.019","ISBN":"0199582599 (hbk.)\\n9780199582594 (hbk.)","ISSN":"10902643","issue":"July 2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"68-85","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Nonlinear tidal dissipation in the subsurface oceans of Enceladus and other icy satellites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.09.019","volume":"319"},

In addition to Jupiter-raised tides, each moon also raises tides on the others. We investigate moon-moon tides for the first time in the Galilean moons and show that they can cause significant heating through the excitation of high-frequency resonant tidal waves in their subsurface oceans. The heating occurs both in the crust and ocean and can exceed that of other tidal sources and radiogenic decay if the ocean is inviscid enough.

Tidal deformation is inherently frequency dependent, an effect which is enhanced when a subsurface ocean is present. We model the tidal response of Europa and Ganymede, taking into account ocean dynamics and the viscoelastic coupling to the ice shell. Tidal deformation at high frequencies - a result of moon-moon interactions - is resonantly amplified by ocean dynamics. We find the corresponding tidal Love numbers to be extremely sensitive to ocean thickness and weakly sensitive to ice shell thickness, shear modulus, and viscosity. Measuring these high-frequency deformations would provide a unique determination of ocean thickness, though the minimum sensitivity required to detect the relevant deformation (0.1 mm, 2 nGal) makes this an extreme challenge. Detection of a large signal on the order of centimeters would only be possible if the ocean was tuned to a particular thickness, which would suggest that moon-moon tides play a role in the thermal/orbital evolution of the moon. Scaling laws are also derived that predict the resonant enhancement of tidal Love numbers and associated tidal dissipation in the ocean and ice shell.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Hay","given":"H.

The asymptotic structure of the internal shear layers is described by extending the self-similar solution known for open domains to closed domains where reﬂections on the boundaries occur. The periodic ray path ensures that the beams remain localised around it. Asymptotic solutions for both the main beam along the critical line and the weaker secondary beam perpendicular to it are obtained.

Science 317, 1384-1387 (paper I)] proposed that Saturn's rotation period can be ascertained by minimizing the dynamic heights of the 100 mbar isosurface with respect to the geoid; they derived a rotation period of 10 h 32 m 35 s. We investigate the same approach for Jupiter to see if the Jovian rotation period is predicted by minimizing the dynamical heights of its isobaric (1 bar pressure level) surface using zonal wind data. A rotation period of 9 h 54 m 29.7 s is found. Further, we investigate the minimization method by fitting Pioneer and Voyager occultation radii for both Jupiter and Saturn. Rotation periods of 9 h 55 m 30 s and 10 h 32 m 35 s are found to minimize the dynamical heights for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. Though there is no dynamical principle requiring the minimization of the dynamical heights of an isobaric surface, the successful application of the method to Jupiter lends support to its relevance for Saturn. We derive Jupiter and Saturn rotation periods using equilibrium theory to explain the difference between equatorial and polar radii. Rotation periods of 9 h 55 m 20 s and 10 h 31 m 49 s are found for Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. We show that both Jupiter's and Saturn's shapes can be derived using solid-body rotation, suggesting that zonal winds have a minor effect on the planetary shape for both planets.

  {"id":"HellerArmstrong2014","abstract":"To be habitable, a world (planet or moon) does not need to be located in the stellar habitable zone (HZ), and worlds in the HZ are not necessarily habitable. Here, we illustrate how tidal heating can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ. Scientists have developed a language that neglects the possible existence of worlds that offer more benign environments to life than Earth does. We call these objects “superhabitable” and discuss in which contexts this term could be used, that is to say, which worlds tend to be more habitable than Earth. In an appendix, we show why the principle of mediocracy cannot be used to logically explain why Earth should be a particularly habitable planet or why other inhabited worlds should be Earth-like.\n\nSuperhabitable worlds must be considered for future follow-up observations of signs of extraterrestrial life. Considering a range of physical effects, we conclude that they will tend to be slightly older and more massive than Earth and that their host stars will likely be K dwarfs. This makes Alpha Centauri B, which is a member of the closest stellar system to the Sun and is supposed to host an Earth-mass planet, an ideal target for searches for a superhabitable world.

  {"id":"HoffEtAl2016","abstract":"We present a study of inertial modes in a differentially rotating spherical shell (spherical Couette flow) experiment with a radius ratio of η=1/3. Inertial modes are Coriolis-restored linear wave modes which often arise in rapidly rotating fluids. Recent experimental work has shown that inertial modes exist in a spherical Couette flow for ωi<ωo, where ωi and ωo are the inner and outer sphere rotation rate. A finite number of particular inertial modes has previously been found. By scanning the Rossby number from -2.5<Ro=(ωi-ωo)/ωo<0 at two fixed ωo, we report the existence of similar inertial modes. However, the behavior of the flow described here differs significantly from previous spherical Couette experiments. We show that the kinetic energy of the dominant inertial mode dramatically increases with decreasing Rossby number, which eventually leads to a wave breaking and an increase of small-scale structures at a critical Rossby number. Such a transition in a spherical Couette flow has not been described before. The critical Rossby number scales with the Ekman number as E1/5. Additionally, the increase of small-scale features beyond the transition transfers energy to a massively enhanced mean flow around the tangent cylinder. In this context, we discuss an interaction between the dominant inertial modes with a geostrophic Rossby mode exciting secondary modes whose frequencies match the triadic resonance condition.","author":[{"family":"Hoff","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Harlander","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Triana","given":"Santiago Andrés"}],"citation-key":"HoffEtAl2016","container-title":"Physical Review Fluids","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevFluids.1.043701","ISSN":"2469990X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"Study of turbulence and interacting inertial modes in a differentially rotating spherical shell experiment","type":"article-journal","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"HoggVillar2024","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist - and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here, we identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders, such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they introduce strong confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses without taking on uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is being asked of all of the natural sciences; that is, we are calling on the scientific communities to take a step back and consider the role and value of ML in their fields; the (partial) answers we give here come from the particular perspective of physics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hogg","given":"David W."},{"family":"Villar","given":"Soledad"}],"citation-key":"HoggVillar2024","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2405.18095","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,28]]},"number":"arXiv:2405.18095","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Is machine learning good or bad for the natural sciences?","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18095"},

  {"id":"Hollerbach2003","abstract":"We consider the fluid flow in a spherical shell in rapid overall rotation, with additionally a differential rotation imposed on the inner sphere. The basic state consists of the axisymmetric Stewartson shear layer situated on the tangent cylinder, the cylinder parallel to the axis of rotation and just touching the inner sphere. In this work we consider the non-axisymmetric instabilities that arise when the differential rotation becomes sufficiently large. We find that the sign of the differential rotation, that is, whether the inner sphere is rotating slightly faster or slightly slower than the outer sphere, is crucial, with positive differential rotations yielding a progression to higher wavenumbers m as the overall rotation rate increases, but negative differential rotations yielding m {=} 1 over almost the entire range of rotation rates. This difference is particularly intriguing, as it has been seen before in one closely related experimental study, but not in another. A prior asymptotic analysis also suggested there should be no difference. We therefore try to understand what subtle features of the flow structures and/or geometries should cause this difference in results. We show that the geometry is the critical feature, with the height along the axis of rotation changing abruptly across the tangent cylinder. We are not able to identify why this should make such a difference, and why only for negative differential rotations. We suggest instead additional experiments and asymptotics to further clarify this point.","author":[{"family":"Hollerbach","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"Hollerbach2003","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/S0022112003005676","ISSN":"<null>","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"289-302","title":"Instabilities of the Stewartson layer Part 1.

  {"id":"Holme1998","abstract":"Measured changes in the Earth's length of day on a decadal timescale are usually attributed to the exchange of angular momentum between the solid mantle and fluid core. One of several possible mechanisms for this exchange is electromagnetic coupling between the core and a weakly conducting mantle. This mechanism is included in recent numerical models of the geodynamo. The 'advective torque', associated with the mantle toroidal field produced by flux rearrangement at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), is likely to be an important part of the torque for matching variations in length of day. This can be calculated from a model of the fluid flow at the top of the outer core; however? results have generally shown little correspondence between the observed and calculated torques. There is a formal non-uniqueness in the determination of the flow from measurements of magnetic secular variation, and unfortunately the part of the flow contributing to the torque is precisely that which is not constrained by the data. Thus, the forward modelling approach is unlikely to be useful. Instead, we solve an inverse problem: assuming that mantle conductivity is concentrated in a thin layer at the CMB (perhaps D \"), we seek flows that both explain the observed secular variation and generate the observed changes in length of day. We obtain flows that satisfy both constraints and are also almost steady and almost geostrophic, and therefore assert that electromagnetic coupling is capable of explaining the observed changes in length of day.","author":[{"family":"Holme","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Holme1998","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-246x.1998.00424.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"page":"167-180","title":"Electromagnetic core-mantle coupling-I.

On short timescales (annual or shorter) the non-tidal component is dominated by the atmosphere, with small contributions from the ocean and hydrological system. On decadal timescales, the dominant contribution is from angular momentum exchange between the solid mantle and fluid outer core. Intradecadal periods have been less clear and have been characterized by signals with a wide range of periods and varying amplitudes, including a peak at about 6 years (refs 2, 3, 4). Here, by working in the time domain rather than the frequency domain, we show a clear partition of the non-atmospheric component into only three components: a decadally varying trend, a 5.9-year period oscillation, and jumps at times contemporaneous with geomagnetic jerks. The nature of the jumps in length of day leads to a fundamental change in what class of phenomena may give rise to the jerks, and provides a strong constraint on electrical conductivity of the lower mantle, which can in turn constrain its structure and composition. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  {"id":"HornschildEtAl2022","abstract":"Due to their sensitivity to conductivity and oceanic transport, magnetic signals caused by the movement of the ocean are a beneficial source of information. Satellite observed tidal-induced magnetic fields have already proven to be helpful to derive Earth’s conductivity or ocean heat content. However, magnetic signals caused by ocean circulation are still unobserved in satellite magnetometer data. We present a novel method to detect these magnetic signals from ocean circulation using an observing system simulation experiment. The introduced approach relies on the assimilation of satellite magnetometer data based on a Kalman filter algorithm. The separation from other magnetic contributions is attained by predicting the temporal behavior of the ocean-induced magnetic field through presumed proxies. We evaluate the proposed method in different test case scenarios. The results demonstrate a possible detectability of the magnetic signal in large parts of the ocean. Furthermore, we point out the crucial dependence on the magnetic signal’s variability and show that our approach is robust to slight spatial and temporal deviations of the presumed proxies. Additionally, we showed that including simple prior spatial constraints could further improve the assimilation results. Our findings indicate an appropriate sensitivity of the detection method for an application outside the presented observing system simulation experiment. Therefore, we finally discussed potential issues and required advances toward the method’s application on original geomagnetic satellite observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hornschild","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Baerenzung","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Saynisch-Wagner","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Irrgang","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Maik"}],"citation-key":"HornschildEtAl2022","container-title":"Earth, Planets and Space","container-title-short":"Earth, Planets and Space","DOI":"10.1186/s40623-022-01741-z","ISSN":"1880-5981","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"page":"182","source":"BioMed Central","title":"On the detectability of the magnetic fields induced by ocean circulation in geomagnetic satellite observations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40623-022-01741-z","volume":"74"},

  {"id":"Hough1895","abstract":"In a paper published in 'Acta Mathematica,’ vol. 16, M. Folie announces the fact that the latitude of places on the earth’s surface is undergoing periodic changes in a period considerably in excess of that which theory has hitherto been supposed to require. This result has been confirmed in a remarkable manner by Dr. S. C. Chandler, in America ( vide ‘ Astronomical Journal,’ vols. 11, 12), who, as the result of an exhaustive examination of almost all the available records of latitude observations for the last half-century, has assigned 427 days as the true period in which the changes are taking place. The old theory, based on the assumption that the earth was rigid throughout, led to a period of 305 days, and M. Folie proposes to account for the extension of this period by attributing a certain amount of freedom to the internal portions of the earth. The earth he supposes to be composed of “a solid shell moving more or less freely on a nucleus consisting of fluid at least at its surface.” The argument advanced by M. Folie in favour of this constitution of the earth, namely, the independence of the motions of the shell and the nucleus, appeared to me to be unsatisfactoiy, and I therefore proposed to myself to test the validity of it by examining a particular case which lent itself to mathematical analysis, namely, that in which the internal surface of the shell is ellipsoidal and the nucleus consists entirely of homogeneous fluid. The principal axes of the shell and of the cavity occupied by fluid are assumed to be coincident, and the oscillations are considered about a state of steady motion in which the axis of rotation coincides with one of these axes. It is clear that a steady motion will be possible in this case, and that such a motion will be secularly stable in the event of the axis of rotation being the axis of greatest moment for both the shell and the cavity.","author":[{"family":"Hough","given":"Samuel"}],"citation-key":"Hough1895","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

  {"id":"Huang1994","abstract":"The coupled-mode theory (CMT) for optical waveguides is reviewed, with emphasis on the analysis of coupled optical waveguides. A brief account of the recent development of the CMT for coupled optical waveguides is given. Issues raised in the debates of the 1980's on the merits and shortcomings of the conventional as well as the improved coupled-mode formulations are discussed. The conventional coupled-mode formulations are set up in a simple, intuitive way. The rigorous CMT is established on the basis of a linear superposition of the modes for individual waveguides. The cross-power terms appear logically as a result of modal nonorthogonality. The cross power is necessary for the self-consistency of the CMT for dissimilar waveguides. The nonorthogonal CMT, though more complicated, yields more-accurate results than the conventional orthogonal CMT for most practical applications. It also leads to the prediction of cross talk in directional couplers. The conventional orthogonal CMT is, however, reliably accurate for describing the power coupling between two weakly coupled, nearly identical waveguides. For dissimilar waveguides, a self-consistent orthogonal CMT can be derived by a redefinition of the coupling coefficients, and it predicts the coupling length and therefore the power exchange between the waveguides accurately if the two waveguides are far apart. Three typical coupler configurations-the uniform, the grating-assisted, and the tapered-are examined in detail. The accuracy, scope of validity, limitations, and extensions of the coupled-mode formulations are discussed in conjunction with each configuration. To verify the arguments in the discussions, comparisons with the exact analytical solutions and the rigorous numerical simulations are made.","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Wei-Ping"}],"citation-key":"Huang1994","container-title":"Journal of the Optical Society of America A","DOI":"10.1364/josaa.11.000963","ISSN":"1084-7529","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"page":"963","title":"Coupled-mode theory for optical waveguides: an overview","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"Huntley1977","abstract":"These notes accompany a course in hydrodynamics taught in Bonn to Master's students. The course has been designed for students who have completed an undergraduate degree in physics and are familiar with the basics of thermodynamics and vector calculus. As the vast majority of undergraduate courses do not include fluid mechanics, no prior knowledge of the subject is assumed. Also not assumed is any knowledge of astrophysics, so that this course is accessible to students studying for a Master's degree in physics. However there is a definite bias towards applications in astrophysics and geophysics, as opposed to applications in engineering – in practice this means that topics given much attention elsewhere, such as boundary layers, pipe flow, and aerodynamics are mentioned only relatively briefly in this course. Many of the principles are illustrated using examples from everyday experience, as in this way the student can develop an intuitive understanding which can then be applied in other contexts. For instance, reference is made to the hydraulic shock formed as water from a tap spreads out across the surface of a wash basin as a connection to the phenomenon of astrophysical shocks. Phenomena in atmospheric physics are also used as a bridge between terrestrial intuition and the astrophysical context. In fact, atmospheric fluid mechanics has a longer history than astrophysical fluids and can be considered more 'advanced'; astrophysicists are well advised to learn from this neighbouring field to avoid reinventing the wheel. At the moment these notes contain little or no material on shocks, convection or turbulence. At present, these topics are taught as a part of this course in two lectures by M. Cantiello. The last quarter of the course (the last two chapters of these notes) concerns magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), essentially an extension of hydrodynamics to electrically conducting fluids; here we cannot draw on terrestrial intuition and must rely purely on theory.

To constrain the parameters of our model we use the seismic activity of the Moon, driven by tidal dissipation from the Earth-Moon interactions. We then apply this model to predict the amount of seismic energy release and largest seismic events on other moons in our Solar System and exoplanetary bodies. We find that many moons in the Solar System should be more seismically active than the Earth's Moon and many exoplanets should exhibit more seismic activity than the Earth. Finally, we examine how temporal-spatial variations in tidal dissipation manifest as variations in the locations and timing of seismic events on these bodies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hurford","given":"T.

  {"id":"IdiniStevenson2022","abstract":"At mid-mission perijove 17, NASA's Juno mission has revealed a $7\\sigma$ discrepancy between Jupiter's observed high-degree tidal response and the theoretical equilibrium tidal response, namely the Love number $k_{42}$. Here, we propose an interpretation for this puzzling disagreement based on an interior-orbital resonance between internal gravity waves trapped in Jupiter's dilute core and the orbital motion of Io. We use simple Jupiter models to calculate a fractional correction $\\Delta k_{42}$ to the equilibrium tidal response that comes from the dynamical tidal response of a $g$-mode trapped in Jupiter's dilute core. Our results suggest that an extended dilute core ($r\\gtrsim0.7R_J$) produces an interior-orbital resonance with Io that modifies Jupiter's tidal response in $\\Delta k_{42}\\sim-11\\%$, allowing us to fit Juno's $k_{42}$. In our proposed self-consistent scenario, Jupiter's dilute core evolves in resonant locking with Io's orbital migration, which allows the interior-orbital resonance to persist over geological timescales. This scenario requires a dilute core that becomes smoother or shrinks over time, together with a $_4^2g_1$ mode ($\\ell,m,n=4,2,1$) with resonant tidal dissipation reaching $Q_4\\sim1000$. Jupiter's dilute core evolution path and the dissipation mechanism for the resonant $_4^2g_1$ mode are uncertain and motivate future analysis. No other alternative exists so far to explain the $7\\sigma$ discrepancy in Juno $k_{42}$. Our proposed interior-orbital resonance can be tested by Juno observations of $k_{42}$ tides raised on Jupiter by Europa as obtained at the end of the extended mission (mid 2025), and by future seismological observations of Jupiter's $_4^2g_1$ mode oscillation frequency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Idini","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"David J."}],"citation-key":"IdiniStevenson2022","container-title":"arXiv:2203.13175 [astro-ph]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,24]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The gravitational imprint of an interior-orbital resonance in Jupiter-Io","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13175"},

These observations, made using seismic data collected by the InSight geophysical mission, have allowed us to construct the first seismically constrained models for the elastic properties of Mars’ core. We observe core-transiting seismic phase SKS from two farside seismic events detected on Mars and measure the travel times of SKS relative to mantle traversing body waves. SKS travels through the core as a compressional wave, providing information about bulk modulus and density. We perform probabilistic inversions using the core-sensitive relative travel times together with gross geophysical data and travel times from other, more proximal, seismic events to seek the equation of state parameters that best describe the liquid iron-alloy core. Our inversions provide constraints on the velocities in Mars’ core and are used to develop the first seismically based estimates of its composition. We show that models informed by our SKS data favor a somewhat smaller (median core radius = 1,780 to 1,810 km) and denser (core density = 6.2 to 6.3 g/cm3) core compared to previous estimates, with a P-wave velocity of 4.9 to 5.0 km/s at the core–mantle boundary, with the composition and structure of the mantle as a dominant source of uncertainty.

  {"id":"Ivers2015","abstract":"We consider incompressible flows in the rapid-rotation limit of small Rossby number and vanishing Ekman number, in a bounded volume with a rigid impenetrable rotating boundary. Physically the flows are inviscid, almost rigid rotations. We interpret the Coriolis force, modified by a pressure gradient, as a linear operator acting on smooth inviscid incompressible flows in the volume. The eigenfunctions of the Coriolis operator $\\boldsymbol{{\\mathcal{C}}}$ so defined are the inertial modes (including any Rossby modes) and geostrophic modes of the rotating volume. We show $\\boldsymbol{{\\mathcal{C}}}$ is a bounded operator and that $-\\text{i}\\boldsymbol{{\\mathcal{C}}}$ is symmetric, so that the Coriolis modes of different frequencies are orthogonal. We prove that the space of incompressible polynomial flows of degree $N$ or less in a sphere is invariant under $\\boldsymbol{{\\mathcal{C}}}$ . The symmetry of $-\\text{i}\\boldsymbol{{\\mathcal{C}}}$ thus implies the Coriolis operator is non-defective on the finite-dimensional space of spherical polynomial flows.

  {"id":"Ivers2017","abstract":"Inertial waves often occur in geophysics and astrophysics since fluids dominated by rotation are common. A simple model to study inertial waves consists of a uniform incompressible fluid filling a rigid tri-axial ellipsoid, which rotates about an arbitrary axis fixed in an inertial frame. The waves are due to the Coriolis force, which can be treated mathematically as a skew-symmetric bounded linear operator C acting on smooth inviscid flows in the ellipsoid. It is shown that the space of incompressible polynomial flows in the ellipsoid of degree N or less is invariant under C. The symmetry of −iC thus implies the Coriolis operator C is non-defective with an orthogonal set of eigenmodes–Coriolis modes–in the finite-dimensional space of inviscid polynomial flows in the ellipsoid. The modes with non-zero eigenvalues are the inertial modes; the zero-eigenvalue modes are geostrophic. This shows the Coriolis modes are polynomials, enables their enumeration and leads to proof of their completeness by using the Weierstrass polynomial approximation theorem. The modes are tilted if the rotation axis is not aligned with a principal axis of the ellipsoid. A basic tool is that the solution of the polynomial Poisson-Neumann problem, i.e. Poisson’s equation with Neumann boundary condition and polynomial data, in an ellipsoid is a polynomial. The tilted Coriolis modes of degree one are explicitly constructed and shown to be the only modes with non-zero angular momentum in the boundary frame. All tilted geostrophic modes are also explicitly constructed.","author":[{"family":"Ivers","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Ivers2017","container-title":"Geophysical & Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics","DOI":"10.1080/03091929.2017.1330412","ISSN":"0309-1929","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,3]]},"page":"333-354","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","title":"Enumeration, orthogonality and completeness of the incompressible Coriolis modes in a tri-axial ellipsoid","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03091929.2017.1330412","volume":"111"},

Whether or not a terrestrial body can sustain an internally generated magnetic field by convection inside its metallic fluid core is determined in part by its initial thermodynamic state and its compositional structure, both of which are in turn set by the processes of accretion and differentiation. Here we show that the cores of Earth- and Venus-like planets should grow with stable compositional stratification unless disturbed by late energetic impacts. They do so because higher abundances of light elements are incorporated into the liquid metal that sinks to form the core as the temperatures and pressures of metal-silicate equilibration increase during accretion. We model this process and determine that this establishes a stable stratification that resists convection and inhibits the onset of a geodynamo. However, if a late energetic impact occurs, it could mechanically stir the core creating a single homogenous region within which a long-lasting geodynamo would operate. While Earth's accretion has been punctuated by a late giant impact with likely enough energy to mix the core (e.g. the impact that formed the Moon), we hypothesize that the accretion of Venus is characterized by the absence of such energetic giant impacts and the preservation of its primordial stratifications.","author":[{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Seth A."},{"family":"Rubie","given":"David C."},{"family":"Hernlund","given":"John"},{"family":"Morbidelli","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Nakajima","given":"Miki"}],"citation-key":"JacobsonEtAl2017","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2017.06.023","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"375-386","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"Formation, stratification, and mixing of the cores of Earth and Venus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.06.023","volume":"474"},

  {"id":"JansenEtAl2023","abstract":"Globally ice-covered oceans have been found on multiple moons in the solar system and may also have been a feature of Earth’s past. However, relatively little is understood about the dynamics of these ice-covered oceans, which affect not only the physical environment but also any potential life and its detectability. A number of studies have simulated the circulation of icy-world oceans, but have come to seemingly widely different conclusions. To better understand and narrow down these diverging results, we discuss the energetic constraints for the circulation on ice-covered oceans, focusing in particular on Snowball Earth, Europa, and Enceladus. The energy input that can drive ocean circulation on ice-covered bodies can be associated with heat and salt ﬂuxes at the boundaries as well as ocean tides and librations. We show that heating from the solid core balanced by heat loss through the ice sheet can drive an ocean circulation, but the resulting ﬂows would be relatively weak and strongly affected by rotation. Salt ﬂuxes associated with freezing and melting at the ice sheet boundary are unlikely to energetically drive a circulation, although they can shape the large-scale circulation when combined with turbulent mixing. Ocean tides and librations may provide an energy source for such turbulence, but the magnitude of this energy source remains highly uncertain for the icy moons, which poses a major obstacle to predicting the ocean dynamics of icy worlds and remains an important topic for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Jansen","given":"Malte F."},{"family":"Kang","given":"Wanying"},{"family":"Kite","given":"Edwin S."},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Yaoxuan"}],"citation-key":"JansenEtAl2023","container-title":"The Planetary Science Journal","container-title-short":"Planet.

As part of the strategy developed to realise this objective, the tidal response of Ganymede’s interior will be constrained by JUICE’s measurements of surface displacements (by the Ganymede Laser Altimeter (GALA) instrument) and variations in the gravitational potential (by the 3GM radio science package) due to the acting diurnal tides. Here we calculate the tidal response at the surface of Ganymede for several plausible internal conﬁgurations in order to analyse the relation between the tidal response and the geophysical parameters that characterise Ganymede’s interior. Similarly to the case of Jupiter’s smallest icy satellite Europa, the tidal response of Ganymede in the presence of a subsurface ocean, which could be as large as about 3.5 m in terms of the induced radial deformation, mostly depends on the structural (thickness, density) and rheological (rigidity, viscosity) properties of the ice-I shell. Nevertheless, the dependence of the tidal response on several geophysical parameters of the interior, in particular on the thickness and rigidity of the ice-I shell, does not allow for the unambiguous determination of the shell thickness from tidal measurements alone. Additional constraints could be provided by the measurement of forced longitudinal librations at the surface, as their amplitude is more sensitive to the rigidity than to the thickness of the shell.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Jara-Orué","given":"H.M."},{"family":"Vermeersen","given":"B.L.A."}],"citation-key":"Jara-OrueVermeersen2016","container-title":"Netherlands Journal of Geosciences - Geologie en Mijnbouw","container-title-short":"Netherlands Journal of Geosciences","DOI":"10.1017/njg.2015.23","ISSN":"0016-7746, 1573-9708","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"en","page":"191-201","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tides on Jupiter's moon Ganymede and their relation to its internal structure","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0016774615000232/type/journal_article","volume":"95"},

In this paper we come back to the apparent drift of the main field as seen at the Earth's surface, and show that there is no evidence for a body drift but rather clear evidence for a latitude-dependent drift. Computing the fluid flow at the core mantle boundary (CMB), in the frozen flux and geostrophic hypothesis, we also obtain, among other components, a clear differential zonal rotation of the fluid, symmetrical with respect to the Equator. This differential rotation changes with time, with a time constant of the order of 10 years. Dynamic considerations lead us to think that, during such a time interval, the change in the zonal toroidal flow inside the core consists of motions in which axial cylindrical annuli rotate rigidly about the Earth's axis of rotation. Then, for the 1969–85 time-span, the change in the core angular momentum is shown to balance the change in the mantle angular momentum.","author":[{"family":"Jault","given":"D"},{"family":"Gire","given":"C"},{"family":"Le Mouel","given":"J L"}],"citation-key":"Jault1988","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/333353a0","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"6171","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"page":"353-356","title":"Westward drift, core motions and exchanges of angular momentum between core and mantle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1038/333353a0","volume":"333"},

The coupling mechanism mediating angular momentum transfer is not clear yet. Here, I revisit local Cartesian models for the pressure stress on a bumpy core-mantle interface. One common approach consists in analysing forced magnetohydrodynamic modes arising from the interaction between a steady flow along the core-mantle interface and boundary topography. The wave amplitude scales as the height of corrugations and the pressure stress as χ2. As expected from Newton's third law, the tangential stress on the fluid is opposite to the tangential stress on the solid. It is exactly compensated by non-zero mean electromagnetic and Coriolis forces, which both result from interactions at infinity and not with the electrically insulating solid. Requiring zero net flux of mass and electrical current at infinity in order to better model closed systems necessitates to restore mean flow acceleration. This makes possible to investigate whether there is momentum transfer into the fluid interior or instead dissipation next to the boundary. Fluid stratification enhances the horizontal stress exerted by the pressure field on the core-mantle boundary but we have yet to describe the mechanism to transport momentum from the boundary into the fluid.","author":[{"family":"Jault","given":"D."}],"citation-key":"Jault2020","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggaa048","ISSN":"1365246X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"951-967","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Tangential stress at the core-mantle interface","type":"article-journal","volume":"221"},

The aim is to draw conclusions regarding the structure of the star, and test theoretical ideas of crust-core coupling and superfluidity.

We apply our model to the handful of proposed observations of free precession that have appeared in the literature. Assuming crust-only precession, we find that all but one of the observations are consistent with there not being any pinned crustal superfluid at all; the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-10 of the total stellar moment of inertia. However, the observations do not rule out the possibility that the crust and neutron superfluid core precess as a single unit. In this case the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-8 of the total stellar moment of inertia. Both of these values are many orders of magnitude less than the 10^-2 value predicted by many theories of pulsar glitches.

When multiplied by a sudden increment of spherical harmonic load change, they give the horizontal and vertical surface displacements and gravity change at all later times. Incremental glacial load changes thus need only be harmonically decomposed, multiplied by the Love numbers and summed to predict the Earth’s response to glacial load redistributions. The computation of viscoelastic Love numbers from the elastic, viscous and adiabatic proﬁles of the Earth is thus the foundation upon which many glacial isostatic adjustment models are based. Usually, viscoelastic Love numbers are computed using the Laplace transform method, employing the correspondence principle to convert the viscoelastic equations of motion into the elastic equations with complex material parameters. This method works well for a fully non-adiabatic Earth, but can accommodate realistic partially adiabatic and fully adiabatic conditions only by changing the Earth’s density proﬁle. An alternative method of Love number computation developed by Cathles (1975) avoids this dilemma by separating the elastic and viscous equations of motion. The separation neglects a small solid-elastic/ﬂuidelastic transition for compressible deformation, but allows freely deﬁning adiabatic, partially adiabatic or fully non-adiabatic proﬁles in the mantle without changing the Earth’s density proﬁle. Here, we update and fully describe this method and show that it produces Love numbers closely similar to those computed for fully non-adiabatic earth models computed by the correspondence principle, ﬁnite element and other methods. The time-domain method produces Love numbers as good as those produced by other methods and can also realistically accommodate any degree of mantle adiabaticity.

  {"id":"KamruzzamanSeyed-Mahmoud2020","abstract":"We use the linear momentum description (LMD) of the dynamics of the Earth in order to investigate the effects of mantle and inner core elasticity on the frequencies of some of the inertial modes of a spherical Earth model with a liquid core. Traditionally, a liquid core with rigid boundaries is considered to study these modes. A Galerkin method is applied to solve the linear momentum and the Poisson’s equations with the relevant boundary conditions at the interfaces. To test the validity of our method, we compute the periods of some of the Earth’s other normal modes such as the Slichter modes and the spheroidal modes and compare the results with the predicted and observed (when available) values in the literature. We show that the computed dimensionless frequencies [ω/ (2 Ω)] of the inertial modes may be significantly affected by the elasticity of the mantle and inner core. For example, the frequencies of the (2,1,1), also known as the spin-over mode (SOM), (4,1,1), (4,2,1) and (4,3,1) modes are changed from 0.5000, - 0.4100 , 0.3060 and 0.8540 for a Poincaré model to 0.4995, - 0.4208 , 0.3150 and 0.8587, respectively. The change in the frequency of the SOM may seem small, but it is consistent with the change in the frequency of the free-core nutation, which is the same mode as the SOM of a wobbling Earth, which changes from ≈ 0.50144 for an Earth model with rigid mantle and inner core to ≈ 0.50116 for an elastic Earth model. We will show that a great advantage of this method is that we ensure that the frequencies are converged and that it may be generalized to solve other problems in geodynamics including the study of the Earth’s free and forced nutation/wobble.","author":[{"family":"Kamruzzaman","given":"Md"},{"family":"Seyed-Mahmoud","given":"Behnam"}],"citation-key":"KamruzzamanSeyed-Mahmoud2020","container-title":"Journal of Geodesy","DOI":"10.1007/s00190-019-01329-8","ISSN":"14321394","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1-15","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","title":"Inertial modes of an Earth model with a compressible fluid core and elastic mantle and inner core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-019-01329-8","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"Kang2023","abstract":"It has been long puzzling whether the ice thickness variations observed on Enceladus can be sustained solely by a polar-amplified bottom heating. The key to this question is to understand how the upward heat transport by convective plumes would be interfered by the temperature and salinity variations beneath the ice due to the ice thickness variations, which, however, has yet to be explored. Here, we find that the horizontal temperature variation induced by the ice topography can easily be orders of magnitude greater than the vertical temperature variation induced by bottom heating using scaling analysis. Due to the dominance of horizontal temperature gradient, convective plumes are completely shut off by a stratified layer under the thin ice formed out of baroclinic adjustment, largely slowing down the vertical tracer transport. The stratified layer will also deflect almost all of the core-generated heating towards the regions with thicker ice shell, destroying the ice thickness gradient. These results allow us to put an upper bound on the core-generated heating on Enceladus, which is crucial for the estimate of habitability. Scaling laws for the bottom heat flux to penetrate the stratification are derived and examined. This scaling can be used to constrain the maximum ice thickness variations induced by heterogeneous bottom heating on icy satellites in general, which can be used to differentiate icy satellites that generate the majority of heat in the ice shell from those that generate the majority of heat in the silicate core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Wanying"}],"citation-key":"Kang2023","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","container-title-short":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/stad2638","ISSN":"0035-8711","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,11]]},"page":"5251-5261","source":"Silverchair","title":"The modulation effect of ice thickness variations on convection in icy ocean worlds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stad2638","volume":"525"},

Assuming steady-state conditions, we show that the meridional overturning circulation of the ocean, driven by heat and salt exchange with the poleward-thinning ice shell, has opposing signs at very low and very high salinities. Regardless of these differing circulations, heat and fresh water converge toward the equator, where the ice is thick, acting to homogenize thickness variations.

  {"id":"KaspiEtAl2009","abstract":"The giant gas planets have hot convective interiors, and therefore a common assumption is that these deep atmospheres are close to a barotropic state. Here we show using a new anelastic general circulation model that baroclinic vorticity contributions are not negligible, and drive the system away from an isentropic and therefore barotropic state. The motion is still aligned with the direction of the axis of rotation as in a barotropic rotating fluid, but the wind structure has a vertical shear with stronger winds in the atmosphere than in the interior. This shear is associated with baroclinic compressibility effects. Most previous convection models of giant planets have used the Boussinesq approximation, which assumes the density is constant in depth; however, Jupiter's actual density varies by four orders of magnitude through its deep molecular envelope. We therefore developed a new general circulation model (based on the MITgcm) that is anelastic and thereby incorporates this density variation. The model's geometry is a full 3D sphere down to a small inner core. It is nonhydrostatic, uses an equation of state suitable for hydrogen-helium mixtures (SCVH), and is driven by an internal heating profile. We demonstrate the effect of compressibility by comparing anelastic and Boussinesq cases. The simulations develop a mean state that is geostrophic and hydrostatic including the often neglected, but significant, vertical Coriolis contribution. This leads to modification of the standard thermal wind relation for a deep compressible atmosphere. The interior flow organizes in large cyclonically rotating columnar eddies parallel to the rotation axis, which drive upgradient angular momentum eddy fluxes, generating the observed equatorial superrotation. Heat fluxes align with the axis of rotation, and provide a mechanism for the transport of heat poleward, which can cause the observed flat meridional emission. We address the issue of over-forcing which is common in such convection models and analyze the dependence of our results on this; showing that the vertical wind structure is not very sensitive to the Rayleigh number. We also study the effect of rotation, showing how the transition from a rapidly to a slowly rotating system affects the dynamics. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  {"id":"KastingEtAl1993","abstract":"A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kasting","given":"James F."},{"family":"Whitmire","given":"Daniel P."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Ray T."}],"citation-key":"KastingEtAl1993","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1006/icar.1993.1010","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",1,1]]},"page":"108-128","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Habitable Zones around Main Sequence Stars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103583710109","volume":"101"},

Initial results from the spacecraft's magnetometer1,2 have indicated that neither Europa nor Callisto have an appreciable internal magnetic field, in contrast to Ganymede3 and possibly Io4. Here we report perturbations of the external magnetic fields (associated with Jupiter's inner magnetosphere) in the vicinity of both Europa and Callisto. We interpret these perturbations as arising from induced magnetic fields, generated by the moons in response to the periodically varying plasma environment. Electromagnetic induction requires eddy currents to flow within the moons, and our calculations show that the most probable explanation is that there are layers of significant electrical conductivity just beneath the surfaces of both moons. We argue that these conducting layers may best be explained by the presence of salty liquid-water oceans, for which there is already indirect geological evidence5,6 in the case of Europa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Khurana","given":"K.

  {"id":"Kida2020","abstract":"The purpose of this work was to design and manufacture a 3D range-modulator for scanned particle therapy. The modulator is intended to create a highly conformal dose distribution with only one fixed energy, simultaneously reducing considerably the treatment time. As a proof of concept, a 3D range-modulator was developed for a spherical target volume with a diameter of 5 cm, placed at a depth of 25 cm in a water phantom. It consists of a large number of thin pins with a well-defined shape and different lengths to modulate the necessary shift of the Bragg peak. The 3D range-modulator was manufactured with a rapid prototyping technique. The FLUKA Monte Carlo package was used to simulate the modulating effect of the 3D rangemodulator and the resulting dose distribution. For that purpose, a special user routine was implemented to handle its complex geometrical contour. Additionally, FLUKA was extended with the capability of intensity modulated scanning. To validate the simulation results, dose measurements were carried out at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center with a 400.41 MeV/u 12C beam. The high resolution dosimetric measurements show a good agreement between simulated and measured dose distributions. Irradiation of the monoenergetic raster plan took 3 seconds, which is approximately 20 times shorter than a comparable plan with 16 different energies. The combination of only one energy and a 3D range-modulator leads to a tremendous decrease in irradiation time. “Interplay effects”, typical for moving targets and pencil beam scanning, can be immensely reduced or disappear completely, making the delivery of a homogeneous dose to moving targets more reliable. Combining high dose conformity, very good homogeneity and extremely short irradiation times, the 3D rangemodulator is considered to become a clinically applicable method for very fast treatment of lung tumours.","author":[{"family":"Kida","given":"Shigeo"}],"citation-key":"Kida2020","container-title":"Fluid Dynamics Research","DOI":"10.1088/1873-7005/ab693c","ISBN":"2123420174","ISSN":"1873-7005","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,12]]},"page":"015513","title":"Steady flow in a rapidly rotating spheroid with weak precession: I","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1873-7005/ab693c","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"KivelsonEtAl2002","abstract":"Data acquired by the Galileo magnetometer on five passes by Ganymede have been used to characterize Ganymede's internal magnetic moments. Three of the five passes were useful for determination of the internal moments through quadrupole order. Models representing the internal field as the sum of dipole and quadrupole terms or as the sum of a permanent dipole field upon which is superimposed an induced magnetic dipole driven by the time varying component of the externally imposed magnetic field of Jupiter's magnetosphere give equally satisfactory fits to the data. The permanent dipole moment has an equatorial field magnitude 719 nT. It is tilted by 176° from the spin axis with the pole in the southern hemisphere rotated by 24° from the Jupiter-facing meridian plane toward the trailing hemisphere. The data are consistent with an inductive response of a good electrical conductor of radius approximately 1 Ganymede radius. Although the data do not enable us to establish the presence of an inductive response beyond doubt, we favor the inductive response model because it gives a good fit to the data using only four parameters to describe the internal sources of fields, whereas the equally good dipole plus quadrupole fit requires eight parameters. An inductive response is consistent with a buried conducting shell, probably liquid water with dissolved electrolytes, somewhere in the first few hundred km below Ganymede's surface. The depth at which the ocean is buried beneath the surface is somewhat uncertain, but our favored model suggests a depth of the order of 150 km. As both temperature and pressure increase with depth and the melting temperature of pure ice decreases to a minimum at ∼170 km depth, it seems possible that near this location, a layer of water would be sandwiched between layers of ice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kivelson","given":"M.

The Europa Clipper Magnetometer (ECM) has been designed and constructed to provide the required high precision, temporally stable measurements over the range of temperatures and other environmental conditions that will be encountered in the solar wind and at Jupiter. Three low-noise, tri-axial ﬂuxgate sensors provided by the University of California, Los Angeles are controlled by an electronics unit developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Each ﬂuxgate sensor measures the vector magnetic ﬁeld over a wide dynamic range (±4000 nT per axis) with a resolution of 8 pT. A rigorous magnetic cleanliness program has been adopted for the spacecraft and its payload. The sensors are mounted far out on an 8.5 m boom to form a conﬁguration that makes it possible to measure the remaining spacecraft ﬁeld and remove its contribution to data from the outboard sensor. This paper provides details of the magnetometer design, implementation and testing, the ground calibrations and planned calibrations in cruise and in orbit at Jupiter, and the methods to be used to extract Europa’s inductive response from the data.

We validate our model by comparisons to previous studies and examine the influence of background magnetic field configuration on two types of magnetohydrodynamic waves. We show that the structure of zonal Magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves for a dipole background field is unstable to small perturbations of the field strength in the equatorial region. Modifications to the wave structures are computed for a range of field configurations.

  {"id":"KnibbevanWestrenen2018","abstract":"We have studied the thermal and magnetic field evolution of planet Mercury with a core of Fe–Si alloy to assess whether an Fe–Si core matches its present-day partially molten state, Mercury's magnetic field strength, and the observed ancient crustal magnetization. The main advantages of an Fe–Si core, opposed to a previously assumed Fe–S core, are that a Si-bearing core is consistent with the highly reduced nature of Mercury and that no compositional convection is generated upon core solidification, in agreement with magnetic field indications of a stable layer at the top of Mercury's core. This study also present the first implementation of a conductive temperature profile in the core where heat fluxes are sub-adiabatic in a global thermal evolution model. We show that heat migrates from the deep core to the outer part of the core as soon as heat fluxes at the outer core become sub-adiabatic. As a result, the deep core cools throughout Mercury's evolution independent of the temperature evolution at the core-mantle boundary, causing an early start of inner core solidification and magnetic field generation. The conductive layer at the outer core suppresses the rate of core growth after temperature differences between the deep and shallow core are relaxed, such that a magnetic field can be generated until the present. Also, the outer core and mantle operate at higher temperatures than previously thought, which prolongs mantle melting and mantle convection. The results indicate that S is not a necessary ingredient of Mercury's core, bringing bulk compositional models of Mercury more in line with reduced meteorite analogues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Knibbe","given":"Jurriën Sebastiaan"},{"family":"Westrenen","given":"Wim","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"KnibbevanWestrenen2018","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2017.11.006","ISSN":"0012-821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,15]]},"language":"en","page":"147-159","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The thermal evolution of Mercury's Fe–Si core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X17306428","volume":"482"},

  {"id":"Koot2010","abstract":"We present an inversion of nutation observations in terms of parameters characterizing the Earth's interior properties. We use a Bayesian inversion in the time-domain, allowing us to take fully into account non-linearities in the nutation model and to reduce the loss of information occurring in frequency-domain inversions. Among the parameters we retrieve are two complex parameters, KCMB and KICB, referred to as 'coupling constants', characterizing the mechanical coupling at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and the inner core boundary (ICB), respectively. Based on a joint inversion of nutation observations provided by different analysis centres, we find Im(KCMB) = (-1.78 ± 0.02) 10-5, Re(KICB) = (1.01 ± 0.02) 10-3 and Im(KICB) = (-1.09 ± 0.03) 10-3 (where the errors correspond to 99.7 per cent confidence intervals). While our value of Im(KCMB) is similar to previous estimates, our new values of Re(KICB) and Im(KICB) are significantly different. This is mainly because of the different inversion strategy that we use and also because of the lengthier record of observation available. We show that, based on existing coupling models, neither viscous nor electromagnetic coupling alone can explain our new values of Re(KICB) and Im(KICB). A combination of these two mechanisms is required and necessitates a radial magnetic field at the ICB of total rms strength between 6 and 7 mT and a kinematic viscosity of the fluid core at the ICB should be between 10 and 30 m2 s-1, depending on the exact partition between viscous and electromagnetic coupling. © 2010 The Authors Journal compilation © 2010 RAS.","author":[{"family":"Koot","given":"L."},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"M."},{"family":"Rivoldini","given":"A."},{"family":"De Viron","given":"O."},{"family":"Dehant","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"Koot2010","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04711.x","ISSN":"0956540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"page":"1279-1294","title":"Constraints on the coupling at the core-mantle and inner core boundaries inferred from nutation observations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://gji.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04711.x","volume":"182"},
  {"id":"KornhuberEtAl2020","abstract":"In an interconnected world, simultaneous extreme weather events in distant regions could potentially impose high-end risks for societies1,2. In the mid-latitudes, circumglobal Rossby waves are associated with a strongly meandering jet stream and might cause simultaneous heatwaves and floods across the northern hemisphere3–6. For example, in the summer of 2018, several heat and rainfall extremes occurred near-simultaneously7. Here we show that Rossby waves with wavenumbers 5 and 7 have a preferred phase position and constitute recurrent atmospheric circulation patterns in summer. Those patterns can induce simultaneous heat extremes in specific regions: Central North America, Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia for wave 5, and Western Central North America, Western Europe and Western Asia for wave 7. The probability of simultaneous heat extremes in these regions increases by a factor of up to 20 for the most severe heat events when either of these two waves dominate the circulation. Two or more weeks per summer spent in the wave-5 or wave-7 regime are associated with 4% reductions in crop production when averaged across the affected regions, with regional decreases of up to 11%. As these regions are important for global food production, the identified teleconnections have the potential to fuel multiple harvest failures, posing risks to global food security8.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Kornhuber","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Coumou","given":"Dim"},{"family":"Vogel","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Lesk","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Donges","given":"Jonathan F."},{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Jascha"},{"family":"Horton","given":"Radley M."}],"citation-key":"KornhuberEtAl2020","container-title":"Nature Climate Change","container-title-short":"Nat.

This setup is intrinsically more asymmetric than the more standard case of Rayleigh-Bénard convection in liquids between parallel plates with fixed temperature boundary conditions. Conditions where there is substantial asymmetry can cause a dramatic change in the nature of convection and we demonstrate that this is the case here. The flows can become pressure- rather than buoyancy-dominated, leading to anomalous heat transport by upflows. Counterintuitively, the background temperature gradient T can develop a subadiabatic layer (where g·T<g·Tad, where g is gravity) although convection remains vigorous at every point across the shell.

  {"id":"Kryukov2020","abstract":"Newtonian and Schrödinger dynamics can be formulated in a physically meaningful way within the same Hilbert space framework. This fact was recently used to discover an unexpected relation between classical and quantum motions that goes beyond the results provided by the Ehrenfest theorem. The Newtonian dynamics was shown to be the Schrödinger dynamics of states constrained to a submanifold of the space of states, identified with the classical phase space of the system. Quantum observables are identified with vector fields on the space of states. The commutators of observables are expressed through the curvature of the space. The resulting embedding of the Newtonian and Schrödinger dynamics into a unified geometric framework is rigid in the sense that the Schrödinger dynamics is a unique extension of the Newtonian one. Under the embedding, the normal distribution of measurement results associated with a classical measurement implies the Born rule for the probability of transition of quantum states. The mathematics of the discovered relationship between the classical and the quantum is reviewed and investigated here in detail and applied to the process of measurement of spin and position observables.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kryukov","given":"Alexey A."}],"citation-key":"Kryukov2020","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","container-title-short":"Journal of Mathematical Physics","DOI":"10.1063/1.5135015","ISSN":"0022-2488, 1089-7658","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"082101","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mathematics of the classical and the quantum","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5135015","volume":"61"},

However, past estimations of the EM coupling torque from surface geomagnetic observations is too weak to account for the observed decadal polar motion. Our recent estimations from numerical geodynamo simulations have shown the opposite. In this paper, we re-examine in detail the EM coupling mechanism and the properties of the magnetic field in the electrically conducting lower mantle (characterized by a thin D″-layer at the base of the mantle). Our simulations find that the toroidal field in the D″-layer from the induction and convection of the toroidal field in the outer core could be potentially much stronger than that from the advection of the poloidal field in the outer core. The former, however, cannot be inferred from geomagnetic observations at the Earth's surface, and is missing in previous EM torque estimated from geomagnetic observations. Our deduction suggests further that this field could make the actual EM coupling torque sufficiently strong, at approximately 5 × 1019 Nm, to excite, and hence explain, the decadal polar motion to magnitude of approximately 10 mas.","author":[{"family":"Kuang","given":"Weijia"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianli"}],"citation-key":"KuangEtAl2019","container-title":"Geodesy and Geodynamics","DOI":"10.1016/j.geog.2019.06.003","ISSN":"16749847","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"356-362","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Reassessment of electromagnetic core-mantle coupling and its implications to the Earth's decadal polar motion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geog.2019.06.003","volume":"10"},

A consequence of their dispersion properties is the breaking of waves reﬂecting from, or being generated at, near-critical slopes. Breaking mechanisms associated with internal solitary waves include bottom boundary layer instabilities, shear instabilities in the interior of the water column, and wave overturning as they shoal. Shoaling can result in the formation of waves with trapped cores either at the surface or at the bottom.

These variations are an immediate consequence of the Earth not being a rigid body. In this book Professor Lambeck discusses the irregular nature of this motion and the geophysical mechanisms responsible for it. A complete analysis of these causes requires a discussion of solid Earth physics, magnetohydrodynamics, oceanography and meteorology. The study of the Earth's rotation is therefore of interest not only to astronomers who wish to explain their observations, but also to many geophysicists who use the astronomers' observations to understand better the Earth's response to a variety of applied forces. The author emphasizes the important contributions made over the last 15 years, this progress being in part a consequence of the overall progress in geophysics and planetary physics and of the developments in space science and technology, which not only require that the Earth's motion be precisely known but which also have provided new and precise methods for monitoring this motion.

When the Prandtl number of fluids is sufficiently small, convection-driven flow, because of predominant inertial effects in its dynamics, is non-geostrophic and in the form of an equatorially symmetric, large-scale inertial wave, and, hence, is able to interact destructively with the precession-driven large-scale inertial wave via nonlinear effects.

  {"id":"LandeauEtAl2022","abstract":"Earth’s magnetic field is generated by fluid motions in the outer core. This geodynamo has operated for over 3.4billion years. However, the mechanism that has sustained the geodynamo for over 75% of Earth’s history remains debated. In this Review, we assess the mechanisms proposed to drive the geodynamo (precession, tides and convection) and their ability to match geomagnetic and palaeomagnetic observations. Flows driven by precession are too weak to drive the geodynamo. Flows driven by tides could have been strong enough in the early Earth, before 1.5billion years ago, when tidal deformation and Earth’s spin rate were larger than they are today. Evidence that the thermal conductivity of Earth’s core could be as high as 250Wm−1 K−1 calls the ability of convection to maintain the dynamo for over 3.4 billion years into question. Yet, convection could supply enough power to sustain a long-lived geodynamo if the thermal conductivity is lower than 100Wm−1 K−1. Exsolution of light elements from the core increases this upper conductivity limit by 15% to 200%, based on the exsolution rates reported so far. Convection, possibly aided by the exsolution of light elements, remains the mechanism most likely to have sustained the geodynamo. The light-element exsolution rate, which remains poorly constrained, should be further investigated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Landeau","given":"Maylis"},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Nataf","given":"Henri-Claude"},{"family":"Cébron","given":"David"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Nathanaël"}],"citation-key":"LandeauEtAl2022","container-title":"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43017-022-00264-1","ISSN":"2662-138X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,10]]},"language":"en","page":"255-269","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sustaining Earth’s magnetic dynamo","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00264-1","volume":"3"},

The boundary conditions are then transformed to the familiar spatial coordinate system. A Lagrangian density capable of giving the Lorentz form of the electromagnetic equations in the material coordinate system is found.

Because of gravitational interactions with their companions, the rotational dynamics of planets and stars involve periodic perturbations of their shape, the direction of their rotational vector, and their rotation rate. These perturbations correspond in planetary terms to tides, precession, and longitudinal libration. We review here the flows driven by those mechanical forcings on rotating spheres and ellipsoids. Special focus is placed on the associated instabilities and on the various routes toward turbulence recently studied. The key point is that mechanical forcings do not provide the energy to the excited flows: They convey part of the available rotational energy and generate intense fluid motions through the excitation of localized jets, shear layers, and resonant inertial modes. Hence, even very small forcings may have large-scale consequences. Mechanically driven flows thus play a fundamental role in planets and stars, significantly influencing their shape, their rotational dynamics, and their magnetic field.","author":[{"family":"Le Bars","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Cébron","given":"David"},{"family":"Le Gal","given":"Patrice"}],"citation-key":"LeBars2015","container-title":"Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014556","ISSN":"0066-4189","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"163-193","title":"Flows Driven by Libration, Precession, and Tides","type":"article-journal","volume":"47"},

This procedure is described under two common assumptions regarding perturbations, that they obey the laws of gasdynamics or of incompressibility. The discovery of an appropriate basis is facilitated bj two different kinds of orthogonal decomposition of the function space. One of these is a decomposition into three subspaces independently of the geometry of the underlying steady-state figure.

  {"id":"LeDizesLeBars2017","abstract":"In this work, we analyse the internal shear layer structures generated by the libration of an axisymmetric object in an unbounded fluid rotating at a rotation rate using direct numerical simulation and small Ekman number asymptotic analysis. We consider weak libration amplitude and libration frequency within the inertial wave interval such that the fluid dynamics is mainly described by a linear axisymmetric harmonic solution. The internal shear layer structures appear along the characteristic cones of angle which are tangent to the librating object at so-called critical latitudes. These layers correspond to thin viscous regions where the singularities of the inviscid solution are smoothed. We assume that the velocity field in these layers is described by the class of similarity solutions introduced by Moore & Saffman (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 264, 1969, pp. 597-634). These solutions are characterized by two parameters only: a real parameter , which measures the strength of the underlying singularity, and a complex amplitude coefficient . We first analyse the case of a disk for which a general asymptotic solution for small Ekman numbers is known when the disk is in a solid plane. We demonstrate that the numerical solutions obtained for a free disk and for a disk in a solid plane are both well described by the asymptotic solution and by its similarity form within the internal shear layers. For the disk, we obtain a parameter corresponding to a Dirac source at the edge of the disk and a coefficient where is the Ekman number. The case of a smoothed librating object such as a spheroid is found to be different. By asymptotically matching the boundary layer solution to similarity solutions close to a critical latitude on the surface, we show that the adequate parameter for the similarity solution is , leading to a coefficient , that is larger than for the case of a disk for small Ekman numbers. A simple general expression for valid for any axisymmetric object is obtained as a function of the local curvature radius at the critical latitude in agreement with this change of scaling. This result is tested and validated against direct numerical simulations.","author":[{"family":"Le Dizès","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Le Bars","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"LeDizesLeBars2017","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2017.473","ISSN":"14697645","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,10]]},"page":"653-675","title":"Internal shear layers from librating objects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0022112017004736/type/journal_article","volume":"826"},

In this paper, we examine pulsational stability of low-m r modes in SPB stars by calculating fully non-adiabatic oscillations of uniformly rotating stars, where m is an integer representing the azimuthal wavenumber around the rotation axis. r modes are rotationally induced, non-axisymmetric, oscillation modes, whose oscillation frequency strongly depends on the rotation frequency of the star. They are conveniently classiﬁed by using two integer indices m and l |m| that deﬁne the asymptotic oscillation frequency 2m /[l (l + 1)] in the limit of → 0. We conﬁrm Savonije’s and Townsend’s ﬁnding that low-m, high-radial order, odd r modes with l = m in SPB stars are excited by the same iron opacity bump mechanism that excites low-frequency g modes of the variables, when the rotation frequency is sufﬁciently high. No even r modes with low m are found to be pulsationally unstable. Since the surface pattern of the temperature perturbation of odd modes is antisymmetric about the equator of the star, observed photometric amplitudes caused by the unstable odd r modes with l = m are strongly dependent on the inclination angle between the axis of rotation and the line of sight. Applying the wave–meanﬂow interaction formalism to non-adiabatic r modes in rapidly rotating SPB models, we ﬁnd that because of the rφ component of the Reynolds stress and the radial transport of the eddy ﬂuctuation of density in the rotating star, the surface rotation is accelerated by the forcing due to the low l = m unstable r modes. We suggest that the amount of angular momentum redistribution in the surface region of the stars can be comparable to that needed to sustain decretion discs found in Be systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"U."}],"citation-key":"Lee2006","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","container-title-short":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09751.x","ISSN":"0035-8711, 1365-2966","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,11]]},"language":"en","page":"677-687","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"r modes of slowly pulsating B stars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09751.x","volume":"365"},

A major obstacle to investigations of planetary interiors, however, is that they are not directly accessible. Most of the geophysical data provide global information that cannot be separated into contributions from the core, the mantle and the crust. The NASA InSight mission changed this situation by providing high-quality seismic and lander radio science data1,2. Here we use the InSight’s radio science data to determine fundamental properties of the core, mantle and atmosphere of Mars. By precisely measuring the rotation of the planet, we detected a resonance with a normal mode that allowed us to characterize the core and mantle separately. For an entirely solid mantle, we found that the liquid core has a radius of 1,835 ± 55 km and a mean density of 5,955–6,290 kg m−3, and that the increase in density at the core–mantle boundary is 1,690–2,110 kg m−3. Our analysis of InSight’s radio tracking data argues against the existence of a solid inner core and reveals the shape of the core, indicating that there are internal mass anomalies deep within the mantle. We also find evidence of a slow acceleration in the Martian rotation rate, which could be the result of a long-term trend either in the internal dynamics of Mars or in its atmosphere and ice caps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Le Maistre","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Rivoldini","given":"Attilio"},{"family":"Caldiero","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Yseboodt","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Baland","given":"Rose-Marie"},{"family":"Beuthe","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Dehant","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Folkner","given":"William M."},{"family":"Buccino","given":"Dustin"},{"family":"Kahan","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Marty","given":"Jean-Charles"},{"family":"Antonangeli","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Badro","given":"James"},{"family":"Drilleau","given":"Mélanie"},{"family":"Konopliv","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Péters","given":"Marie-Julie"},{"family":"Plesa","given":"Ana-Catalina"},{"family":"Samuel","given":"Henri"},{"family":"Tosi","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Wieczorek","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Lognonné","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Panning","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Smrekar","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Banerdt","given":"W.

  {"id":"LiEtAl2018","abstract":"Earth’s magnetic field is generated in its fluid metallic core through motional induction in a process termed the geodynamo. Fluid flow is heavily influenced by a combination of rapid rotation (Coriolis forces), Lorentz forces (from the interaction of electrical currents and magnetic fields) and buoyancy; it is believed that the inertial force and the viscous force are negligible. Direct approaches to this regime are far beyond the reach of modern high-performance computing power, hence an alternative ‘reduced’ approach may be beneficial. Taylor ( Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 274 (1357), 1963, pp. 274–283) studied an inertia-free and viscosity-free model as an asymptotic limit of such a rapidly rotating system. In this theoretical limit, the velocity and the magnetic field organize themselves in a special manner, such that the Lorentz torque acting on every geostrophic cylinder is zero, a property referred to as Taylor’s constraint. Moreover, the flow is instantaneously and uniquely determined by the buoyancy and the magnetic field. In order to find solutions to this mathematical system of equations in a full sphere, we use methods of optimal control to ensure that the required conditions on the geostrophic cylinders are satisfied at all times, through a conventional time-stepping procedure that implements the constraints at the end of each time step. A derivative-based approach is used to discover the correct geostrophic flow required so that the constraints are always satisfied. We report a new quantity, termed the Taylicity, that measures the adherence to Taylor’s constraint by analysing squared Lorentz torques, normalized by the squared energy in the magnetic field, over the entire core. Neglecting buoyancy, we solve the equations in a full sphere and seek axisymmetric solutions to the equations; we invoke    $\\unicode[STIX]{x1D6FC}$   - and    $\\unicode[STIX]{x1D714}$   -effects in order to sidestep Cowling’s anti-dynamo theorem so that the dynamo system possesses non-trivial solutions. Our methodology draws heavily on the use of fully spectral expansions for all divergenceless vector fields. We employ five special Galerkin polynomial bases in radius such that the boundary conditions are honoured by each member of the basis set, whilst satisfying an orthogonality relation defined in terms of energies. We demonstrate via numerous examples that there are stable solutions to the equations that possess a rapidly decreasing spectrum and are thus well-converged. Classic distributions for the    $\\unicode[STIX]{x1D6FC}$   - and    $\\unicode[STIX]{x1D714}$   -effects are invoked, as well as new distributions. One such new    $\\unicode[STIX]{x1D6FC}$   -effect model possesses oscillatory solutions for the magnetic field, rarely before seen. By comparing our Taylor state model with one that allows torsional oscillations to develop and decay, we show the equilibrium state of both configurations to be coincident. In all our models, the geostrophic flow dominates the ageostrophic flow. Our work corroborates some results previously reported by Wu & Roberts ( Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn. , vol. 109 (1), 2015, pp. 84–110), as well as presenting new results; it sets the stage for a three-dimensional implementation where the system is driven by, for example, thermal convection.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Kuan"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Livermore","given":"Philip W."}],"citation-key":"LiEtAl2018","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2018.569","ISSN":"14697645","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"647-697","title":"Taylor state dynamos found by optimal control: Axisymmetric examples","type":"article-journal","volume":"853"},

We consider a simplified model consisting of a rigid core and a fluid envelope, permeated by a background magnetic field (either a dipolar field or a uniform axial field). The wavelike tidal responses in the fluid layer are in the form of magnetic-Coriolis waves, which are restored by both the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force. Energy dissipation occurs through viscous damping and Ohmic damping of these waves. Our numerical results show that the tidal dissipation can be dominated by Ohmic damping even with a weak magnetic field. The presence of a magnetic field smooths out the complicated frequency-dependence of the dissipation rate, and broadens the frequency spectrum of the dissipation rate, depending on the strength of the background magnetic field. However, the frequency-averaged dissipation is independent of the strength and structure of the magnetic field, and of the dissipative parameters, in the approximation that the wave-like response is driven only by the Coriolis force acting on the non-wavelike tidal flow. Indeed, the frequency-averaged dissipation quantity is in good agreement with previous analytical results in the absence of magnetic fields. Our results suggest that the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation of the wavelike perturbations is insensitive to detailed damping mechanisms and dissipative properties.","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Yufeng"},{"family":"Ogilvie","given":"Gordon I."}],"citation-key":"Lin2018","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/stx2764","ISSN":"13652966","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1644-1656","title":"Tidal dissipation in rotating fluid bodies: The presence of a magnetic field","type":"article-journal","volume":"474"},
  {"id":"LindbomIpser1999","abstract":"Analytical solutions are presented for a class of generalized r-modes of rigidly rotating uniform density stars---the Maclaurin spheroids---with arbitrary values of the angular velocity. Our analysis is based on the work of Bryan; however, we derive the solutions using slightly different coordinates that give purely real representations of the r-modes. The class of generalized r-modes is much larger than the previously studied `classical' r-modes. In particular, for each l and m we find l-m (or l-1 for the m=0 case) distinct r-modes. Many of these previously unstudied r-modes (about 30% of those examined) are subject to a secular instability driven by gravitational radiation. The eigenfunctions of the `classical' r-modes, the l=m+1 case here, are found to have particularly simple analytical representations. These r-modes provide an interesting mathematical example of solutions to a hyperbolic eigenvalue problem.","author":[{"family":"Lindbom","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Ipser","given":"James R."}],"citation-key":"LindbomIpser1999","container-title":"Physical Review D - Particles, Fields, Gravitation and Cosmology","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevD.59.044009","ISSN":"15502368","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"page":"1-13","title":"Generalized r-modes of the Maclaurin spheroids","type":"article-journal","volume":"59"},

Tidal dissipation is signiﬁcantly enhanced at some frequencies, suggesting possible resonances between the tidal forcing and some eigenmodes. However, the nature of these resonances remains enigmatic owing to the singularity of the eigenvalue problem of inertial waves, and the resonances are often mistakenly attributed to wave attractors in the literature. In this letter, we reveal that resonant tidal responses correspond to inertial modes with large-scale ﬂows hidden beneath localized wave beams. Strong couplings between the tidal forcing and the hidden large-scale ﬂows intensify the localized wave beams emanating from the critical latitudes, leading to enhanced tidal dissipation.

  {"id":"LockitchFriedman1999","abstract":"Almost none of the r-modes ordinarily found in rotating stars exist, if the star and its perturbations obey the same one-parameter equation of state; and rotating relativistic stars with one-parameter equations of state have no pure r-modes at all, no modes whose limit, for a star with zero angular velocity, is a perturbation with axial parity. Similarly (as we show here), rotating stars of this kind have no pure g-modes, no modes whose spherical limit is a perturbation with polar parity and vanishing perturbed pressure and density. Where have these modes gone? In spherical stars of this kind, r-modes and g-modes form a degenerate zero-frequency subspace. We find that rotation splits the degeneracy to zeroth order in the star's angular velocity Omega, and the resulting modes are generically hybrids, whose limit as Omega-->0 is a stationary current with axial and polar parts. Lindblom & Ipser have recently found these hybrid modes in an analytic study of the Maclaurin spheroids. Since the hybrid modes have a rotational restoring force, they call them ``rotation modes'' or ``generalized r-modes.'' Because each mode has definite parity, its axial and polar parts have alternating values of l. We show that each mode belongs to one of two classes, axial-led or polar-led, depending on whether the spherical harmonic with lowest value of l that contributes to its velocity field is axial or polar. We numerically compute these modes for slowly rotating polytropes and for Maclaurin spheroids, using a straightforward method that appears to be novel and robust. Timescales for the gravitational-wave driven instability and for viscous damping are computed using assumptions appropriate to neutron stars. The instability to nonaxisymmetric modes is, as expected, dominated by the l=m r-modes with simplest radial dependence, the only modes which retain their axial character in isentropic models; for relativistic isentropic stars, these l=m modes must also be replaced by hybrids of the kind considered here.","author":[{"family":"Lockitch","given":"Keith H."},{"family":"Friedman","given":"John L."}],"citation-key":"LockitchFriedman1999","container-title":"The Astrophysical Journal","DOI":"10.1086/307580","ISSN":"0004-637X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"page":"764-788","title":"Where are the r ‐Modes of Isentropic Stars?","type":"article-journal","volume":"521"},
  {"id":"Longuet-Higgins1965","abstract":"This paper investigates the low-frequency solutions to the tidal equations on a sphere under the conditions that the wavenumber n is fairly large and that 4Ω 2 / ghn 2 ≼ O (1), where Ω is the angular rotation velocity of the sphere, g the gravitational constant, h the depth (assumed constant), and the radius of the sphere is taken as unity. It is shown that the equa­tions reduce to the spheroidal wave equation the solutions of which, as the result of recent investigations, can be considered as known functions. In the special case when 4Ω 2 / ghn 2 ≪ 1 one obtains the non-divergent planetary waves, studied in a previous paper (Longuet-Higgins 1964 a ). On the other hand, near to the equator the solutions can be represented approxi­mately by parabolic cylinder functions, a special case considered by Rattray (1964) and Bretherton (1964). The present paper thus unifies the work of these authors. Next the β -plane approximation is studied. It is shown that whereas the spheroidal wave approximation is valid to order n -2 the β -plane approximation is valid only to order n -1 except near the equator, where it is valid to order n -2 . The β -plane approximation is used to interpret the local character of solutions in an unbounded region on the sphere, and to obtain new solutions in closed basins of rectangular, triangular or circular shape. By means of the spheroidal wave approximation, the trajectories of wave packets on the surface of a sphere are calculated. The trajectories always lie between two critical latitude circles (one north and one south of the equator). Polewards of these latitudes the disturbance in any given mode is small. The critical latitudes themselves form ray caustics, where the amplitude is particularly large. The width of the caustic zone is of order n -2/3 , and cannot be adequately described by the β -plane approximation with constant β . This explains some difficulties in a previous attempt by Arons & Stommel (1956) to describe waves travelling due east or due west, using a β -plane approximation. At a given latitude there is a minimum period for waves of planetary type. Waves of this period are easily excited and may be prominent in the oceans. The theory is readily extended to internal (or baroclinic) waves. It is suggested that some deep currents observed in the Atlantic by J. C. Swallow (1961) were planetary waves at the cutoff period.","author":[{"family":"Longuet-Higgins","given":"Michael Selwyn"}],"citation-key":"Longuet-Higgins1965","container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

  {"id":"Longuet-Higgins1968","abstract":"Numerical calculations are presented for the eigenvalues of Laplace's tidal equations governing a thin layer of fluid on a rotating sphere, for a complete range of the parameter $\\epsilon $ = 4$\\Omega ^{2}$R$^{2}$/gh ($\\Omega $ = rate of rotation, R = radius, g = gravity, h = depth of fluid layer). The corresponding eigenfunctions or `Hough functions' are shown graphically for the lower modes of oscillation. Negative values of $\\epsilon $, which have application in problems involving forced motions, are also considered. The calculations reveal many asymptotic forms of the solution for various limiting values of $\\epsilon $. The corresponding analytical expressions are derived in the present paper. Thus, as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow $ 0 through positive values we have the well-known waves of the first and second class respectively, which were found by Margules and Hough. These can be represented in terms of spherical harmonics. As $\\epsilon \\rightarrow $ + $\\infty $ there are three distinct asymptotic forms. In each of these the energy is concentrated near the equator. In the first type, the kinetic energy is three times the potential energy. In the other two types the kinetic and potential energies are equal. The waves of the second type are all propagated towards the west. The waves of the third type are Kelvin waves propagated eastwards along the equator. All three types are described in terms of Hermite polynomials. As $\\epsilon \\rightarrow $ 0 through negative values there is only one asymptotic form of solution, representing motions which are analytically continuous with Hough's `waves of the second class'. As $\\epsilon \\rightarrow $ - $\\infty $ there are three different asymptotic forms, in each of which the energy tends to be concentrated near the poles of rotation. In the first two types the energy is mainly kinetic and the motion is in inertial circles. In the third type the energy is mainly potential. The modes tend to occur in pairs of almost the same frequency, one being symmetric and the other antisymmetric about the equator. The analytical forms of the solutions involve generalized Laguerre polynomials. In the special case of zonal oscillations, the first two limiting forms as $\\epsilon \\rightarrow $ - $\\infty $ go over into a different form in which the frequency tends to zero as $\\epsilon $ tends to a finite negative value. In this case the third type does not occur. The way in which the various asymptotic solutions are connected can be traced in figures 1 to 6 ($\\epsilon $ > 0) and figures 16 to 21 ($\\epsilon $ < 0). Accurate values of the eigenfrequencies, covering the range -10$^{4}$ < $\\epsilon $ < 10$^{4}$ are tabulated in tables 1 to 10.

Large-scale flows are dominated by vortical motions1 and appear to be weaker than expected in the solar interior2. One possibility is that waves of vorticity due to the Coriolis force, known as Rossby waves3 or r modes4, remove energy from convection at the largest scales5. However, the presence of these waves in the Sun is still debated. Here, we unambiguously discover and characterize retrograde-propagating vorticity waves in the shallow subsurface layers of the Sun at azimuthal wavenumbers below 15, with the dispersion relation of textbook sectoral Rossby waves. The waves have lifetimes of several months, well-defined mode frequencies below twice the solar rotational frequency, and eigenfunctions of vorticity that peak at the equator. Rossby waves have nearly as much vorticity as the convection at the same scales, thus they are an essential component of solar dynamics. We observe a transition from turbulence-like to wave-like dynamics around the Rhines scale6 of angular wavenumber of approximately 20.

  {"id":"Love1909","abstract":"The problem of determining how much the earth as a whole actually yields to the tidal disturbing forces of the sun and moon was definitely brought before scientific men by Lord Kelvin. He pointed out that, from observations of the tides of long period, it ought to be possible to obtain some definite information, and he urged the establishment of gravitational observatories fitted with instruments for detecting the lunar disturbance of gravity. However rigid the body of the earth may be, it necessarily yields a little to the deforming action of the sun and moon. This action produces two kinds of effect. In the first place, it alters the shape of the earth. If the earth were a perfect sphere, it would be drawn out by the attraction of the moon, for instance, into a prolate ellipsoid of revolution. The actual earth, of a shape that is nearly spherical but presents certain inequalities, acquires under the action of the moon a slight additional inequality of figure, of the same type as that which answers to elongation in the direction of the long axis of the ellipsoid and flatten ing round the parts remote from that axis. As the moon moves relatively to the earth, the long axis of the ellipsoid moves about in the earth, so that a corporeal tide is raised in the earth. Besides raising a corporeal tide, the action of the moon alters the attraction of the earth. If the change of external shape only is taken into account, the alteration of the attraction consists of the added attraction, due to the protuberances at the ends of the long axis of the ellipsoid, coupled with the loss of attraction, due to the flattening round the parts remote from these ends. But, since the material of which the earth is made up is not homogeneous, a similar effect is produced by the elongation and flattening of the surfaces of equal density, and, since the material is not absolutely incompressible, the density must be in some parts increased and in others diminished, owing to the attraction of the moon being different in different parts. The alteration of the earth's attraction by the action of the moon is therefore of a somewhat complex character. The effects produced by the action of the sun are similar to those produced by the action of the moon.","author":[{"family":"Love","given":"A. E.

Here we examine the possibility that core‐mantle coupling is predominantly electromagnetic and thus responsible for the decadal length of day variations. the electromagnetic couple on the mantle can be divided into poloidal and toroidal parts, and, by requiring continuity of the horizontal component of the electric field at the core‐mantle boundary, the toroidal couple can be divided into separate advective and leakage parts. the poloidal couple results entirely from the interaction of the poloidal field with currents induced by its time variation; the advective couple results from the dragging of poloidal field lines through a conducting mantle; and the leakage couple results from the diffusion of toroidal magnetic field from the core's interior into the mantle. the poloidal and advective couples can be estimated by using models of the downward continued poloidal field and models of the core velocity. We find that neither the poloidal couple nor the advective couple exhibit sufficient variability to account for the decadal length of day variations. If this is true, and if core‐mantle coupling is indeed predominantly electromagnetic, then most of the variability in the length of day must result from the leakage couple, which, unfortunately, cannot be calculated directly from surface observations. We assume that the horizontal component of the magnetic field is continuous across the core‐mantle boundary, that the frozen‐flux approximation adequately describes the time dependence of the horizontal component of the magnetic field at the core surface, and that most of this time dependence results from steady core motion. Then by treating the determination of the toroidal field at the core‐mantle boundary as an inverse problem, we find that only very strong and spatially complex toroidal field models are consistent with both advection in the core and the decadal length of day variations. We argue that strong toroidal fields are necessary to account for the length‐of‐day variations since there is significant cancellation when the magnetic stress is integrated over the core‐mantle boundary (CMB), the necessary time‐dependent torque resulting from the slight and temporary non‐cancellation of magnetic stress established by a slowly varying and spatially complex toroidal field. But, since our toroidal field models are too strong according to dynamo theory, produce electric fields at the Earth's surface which are stronger than measured values, and produce ohmic heating which either exceeds or contributes an unacceptably large fraction of the Earth's surface heat flow, we deem the toroidal‐field models consistent with our analysis of electromagnetic coupling to be physically unreasonable. Thus, we argue that core‐mantle coupling is not predominantly electromagnetic. However, this conclusion may not hold if, for example, core motion is highly time dependent, or if a strong diffusive boundary layer is present beneath the core‐mantle boundary, the presence of which may allow for a significant discontinuity in the horizontal component of the magnetic field and the breakdown of the frozen‐flux approximation.

  {"id":"Luan2019","abstract":"The dynamic quadrupole Love number of Titan measured by \\Cassini is $k_\\mathrm{2,obs}=0.616\\pm 0.067$, strongly indicating a global subsurface ocean. However, the theoretical Love number due to equilibrium tides is at most $k_\\mathrm{2,eq}^\\mathrm{max}\\approx 0.48$ in the absence of an ice shell on top of the ocean. In reality, there is an outer ice shell of thickness $ 100\\,\\mathrm{km}$, reducing the equilibrium-tide Love number to $k_\\mathrm{2,eq}\\approx 0.42$. Therefore, other types of tidal response, like dynamic tides, may be also present in Titan. We propose that the ocean is stably stratified. As a result, there exist standing ocean waves (gravity modes) with eigen-frequencies close to the tidal frequency. Such a gravity mode (g-mode) is resonantly excited. It bends the outer ice shell radially and thus enhances the dynamic Love number by $k_\\mathrm{2,g}$. In order for $k_\\mathrm{2,g}$ to account for the discrepancy between $k_\\mathrm{2,eq}$ and $k_\\mathrm{2,obs}$, the Brunt-Vaisala frequency in the ocean is required to be $3.3\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{rad\\, s^{-1}}$. It is compatible with the volatile-rich model for Titan that was proposed to explain the methane-rich atmosphere. The three components of the tidal potential with azimuthal degrees, $m=-2,0,2$, correspond to the three components of the quadrupole Love number, $k_\\mathrm{2,-2}$, $k_\\mathrm{2,0}$ and $k_\\mathrm{2,2}$. They can excite retrograde, axisymmetric and prograde g-modes equally in the absence of rotation. However, Coriolis force induced by Titan's rotation breaks the symmetry among these modes. Most likely, only one of the Love-number components is significantly enhanced by a g-mode, while the other two are still attributed to equilibrium tides. This prediction is testable by observation. If confirmed, the smaller components of the Love number can be used to constrain the thickness of the outer ice shell.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Luan","given":"Jing"}],"citation-key":"Luan2019","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.1905.03802","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,9]]},"number":"arXiv:1905.03802","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Titan's Dynamic Love Number Implies Stably-Stratified Ocean","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03802"},
  {"id":"LuEtAl2014","abstract":"The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a project to assemble a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) network of mm wavelength dishes that can resolve strong field General Relativistic signatures near a supermassive black hole. As planned, the EHT will include enough dishes to enable imaging of the predicted black hole \"shadow\", a feature caused by severe light bending at the black hole boundary. The center of M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, presents one of the most interesting EHT targets as it exhibits a relativistic jet, offering the additional possibility of studying jet genesis on Schwarzschild radius scales. Fully relativistic models of the M87 jet that fit all existing observational constraints now allow horizon-scale images to be generated. We perform realistic VLBI simulations of M87 model images to examine detectability of the black shadow with the EHT, focusing on a sequence of model images with a changing jet mass load radius. When the jet is launched close to the black hole, the shadow is clearly visible both at 230 and 345 GHz. The EHT array with a resolution of 20-30$\\mu$as resolution ($\\sim$2-4 Schwarzschild radii) is able to image this feature independent of any theoretical models and we show that imaging methods used to process data from optical interferometers are applicable and effective for EHT data sets. We demonstrate that the EHT is also capable of tracing real-time structural changes on a few Schwarzschild radii scales, such as those implicated by VHE flaring activity of M87. While inclusion of ALMA in the EHT is critical for shadow imaging, generally the array is robust against loss of a station.","author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Ru Sen"},{"family":"Broderick","given":"Avery E."},{"family":"Baron","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Monnier","given":"John D."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Vincent L."},{"family":"Doeleman","given":"Sheperd S."},{"family":"Pankratius","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"LuEtAl2014","container-title":"Astrophysical Journal","DOI":"10.1088/0004-637X/788/2/120","ISSN":"15384357","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"title":"Imaging the supermassive black hole shadow and jet base of M87 with the event horizon telescope","type":"article-journal","volume":"788"},

  {"id":"Maas2001","abstract":"Rotating fluids support waves. These inertial waves propagate obliquely through the fluid, with an angle that is fixed with respect to the rotation axis. Upon reflection, their wavelength is unchanged only when the wall obeys the local reflectional symmetry, that is, when it is either parallel or perpendicular to the rotation axis. For internal gravity waves in a density-stratified fluid, sloping boundaries thus break the symmetry of ray paths, in a two-dimensional container, predicting their focusing upon attractors: Particular paths onto which the wave rays, and hence the energy, converge, and to which the wave energy returns after a small number of refections. Laboratory observations, presented here, show that, despite the intrinsic three-dimensionality of inertial waves, attractors still occur. The intensified wave energy on the attractor encourages centrifugal instabilities, leading to a mean flow. Evidence of this comes from dye spreading, observed to develop most rapidly over the location where the attractor reflects from the sloping wall, being the place where focusing and instabilities occur. This mean flow, resulting from the mixing of angular momentum, accompanying the intensification of the wave field at that location, has geophysical implications, because the ocean, atmosphere and Earth's liquid outer core can be regarded as asymmetrically contained. The relevance of wave focusing in a rotating, spherical shell, the modifications due to the addition of radial stratification, and its implications for observed equatorial current patterns and inertial oscillations are discussed. The well-known universality of oceanic, gravito-inertial wave spectra might reflect complementary, divergent (chaotic) wave-ray behaviour, which occurs in containers obeying the reflectional symmetry, but in which symmetry is broken in the horizontal plane. Periodic orbits still exist, but now repell.","author":[{"family":"Maas","given":"L.

  {"id":"Maas2003","abstract":"Enclosed rotating homogeneous fluids support waves that are restored by Coriolis forces. These waves propagate obliquely through the fluid under a fixed angle with respect to the rotation axis which is set by the ratio of the frequency of the wave and the inertial frequency (twice the angular frequency of the tank). In the particular case that boundaries are either parallel, or perpendicular to the rotation axis, eigenmodes may be expected. An example is Kelvin's (1880) axial can. However, the spatial structure of these waves can still be quite complicated, as shown here for waves in a 'horizontal' rectangular parallelepiped. The container's rigid horizontal top and bottom surfaces allow for modal expansion in the vertical, each mode being governed by the 'inertial' analogs of surface Poincaré and Kelvin waves. Combining these, as in the Taylor problem of reflecting surface Kelvin waves, one finds both the eigenfrequencies as well as the typical amphidromic structure (phase lines circling around nodal points) of the resulting inertial wave pattern in dependence of the remaining two parameters: the horizontal and vertical aspect ratios. This entails the approximative determination of eigenvalues of an infinite matrix equation, obtained with the Proudman-Rao method. It appears that certain specific frequencies persist as eigenfrequency for different aspect ratios, albeit belonging to different eigenmodes. Surprisingly, these correspond to the eigenfrequencies of an infinitely long channel of waves lacking along-channel structure. Inertial wave patterns are presented by means of the amplitude and phase of the internal elevation field (related to the axial velocity component) and of the two horizontal velocity components. These reveal predominant anticyclonic turning of phase and currents; maximum elevation and current amplitudes detached from the solid walls; and, occasionally, a nearly sloshing type of response (nodal lines, instead of points). © 2003 Published by The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.

The belief that enclosed continuous media always possess eigenmodes is deeply rooted. Internal gravity waves in uniformly stratified fluids, however, present a counter-example. Such waves propagate at a fixed angle to the vertical that is determined solely by the forcing frequency, and a sloping side wall of the container will therefore act as a lens, resulting in ray convergence or divergence. An important consequence of this geometric focusing is the prediction that following multiple reflections, these waves will evolve onto specific paths - or attractors - whose locations are determined only by the frequency. Here we report the results of laboratory experiments that confirm that internal-wave attractors, rather than eigenmodes, determine the response of a confined, stably stratified fluid over a broad range of vibration frequencies.

Weak coupling phenomena-veering and locking-arise when branches of the dispersion curves interact. These occur in the vicinity of the frequency at which, for undamped waveguides, the dispersion curves in the uncoupled waveguides would cross: if two dispersion curves (representing either propagating or evanescent waves) come close together as frequency increases then the curves either veer apart or lock together, forming a pair of attenuating oscillatory waves, which may later unlock into a pair of either propagating or evanescent waves. Which phenomenon occurs depends on the product of the gradients of the dispersion curves. The wave mode shapes which describe the deformation of the structure under the passage of a wave change rapidly around this critical frequency. These phenomena also occur in damped systems unless the levels of damping of the uncoupled waveguides are sufficiently different.

  {"id":"MaffeiEtAl2017","abstract":"We consider fluid-filled spheres and spheroidal containers of eccentricity ϵ in rapid rotation, as a proxy for the interior dynamics of stars and planets. The fluid motion is assumed to be quasi-geostrophic (QG): horizontal motions are invariant parallel to the rotation axis z, a characteristic which is handled by use of a stream function formulation which additionally enforces mass conservation and non-penetration at the boundary. By linearizing about a quiescent background state, we investigate a variety of methods to study the QG inviscid inertial wave modes which are compared with fully three-dimensional (3D) calculations. We consider the recently proposed weak formulation of the inviscid system valid in spheroids of arbitrary eccentricity, to which we present novel closed-form polynomial solutions. Our modal solutions accurately represent, in both spatial structure and frequency, the most z-invariant of the inertial wave modes in a spheroid, and constitute a simple basis set for the analysis of rotationally dominated fluids.

  {"id":"MajumderSreenivasan2023","abstract":"The secular variation of the geomagnetic field suggests that there are anticyclonic polar vortices in the Earth's core. Under the influence of a magnetic field, the polar azimuthal flow is thought to be produced by one or more coherent upwellings within the tangent cylinder, offset from the rotation axis. In this study, convection within the tangent cylinder in rapidly rotating dynamos is investigated through the analysis of forced magnetic waves. The first part of the study investigates the evolution of an isolated buoyancy disturbance in an unstably stratified rotating fluid subjected to an axial magnetic field. It is shown that the axial flow intensity of the slow Magnetic-Archimedean-Coriolis (MAC) waves becomes comparable to that of the fast MAC waves when ∣ωM/ωC∣∼0.1, where ωM and ωC are the Alfvén wave and inertial wave frequencies respectively. In spherical shell dynamo simulations, the isolated upwellings within the tangent cylinder are shown to originate from the localized excitation of slow MAC waves in the dipole-dominated regime. Axial flow measurements in turn reveal the approximate parity between the slow and fast wave intensities in this regime, which corresponds to the existence of strong polar vortices in the Earth's core. To obtain the observed peak azimuthal motions of 0.6–0.9∘yr−1, the Rayleigh number in the low-inertia geodynamo must be ∼103 times the Rayleigh number for the onset of nonmagnetic convection. However, if the forcing is so strong as to cause polarity reversals, the field within the tangent cylinder decays away, and the convection takes the form of an ensemble of plumes supported entirely by the fast waves of frequency ω∼ωC. The resulting weak polar circulation is comparable to that obtained in nonmagnetic convection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Majumder","given":"Debarshi"},{"family":"Sreenivasan","given":"Binod"}],"citation-key":"MajumderSreenivasan2023","container-title":"Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors","container-title-short":"Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors","DOI":"10.1016/j.pepi.2023.107105","ISSN":"0031-9201","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,20]]},"page":"107105","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The role of magnetic waves in tangent cylinder convection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031920123001310"},

The model further considers the following energy sources and sinks: tidal heating, radiogenic heating, geochemical energy released by serpentinization or absorbed by mineral dehydration, gravitational energy and insolation, and heat transport by conduction, convection, and advection. We apply the model to Enceladus, by guessing the initial conditions that would render a structure compatible with present-day observations, assuming the initial structure to have been homogeneous. Assuming the satellite has been losing water continually along its evolution, we postulate that it was formed as a more massive, more icy and more porous satellite, and gradually transformed into its present day state due to sustained long-term tidal heating. We consider several initial compositions and evolution scenarios and follow the evolution for the age of the Solar System, testing the present day model results against the available observational constraints. Our model shows the present configuration to be differentiated into a pure icy mantle, several tens of km thick, overlying a rocky core, composed of dehydrated rock at the center and hydrated rock in the outer part. For Enceladus, it predicts a higher rock/ice mass ratio than previously assumed and a thinner ice mantle, compatible with recent estimates based on gravity field measurements.

  {"id":"MalinEtAl1982","abstract":"Evidence for the presence of undulations or temperature variations, or both, at the core-mantle boundary comes from the remarkably high correlation between the pattern of long-wavelength gravitational anomalies and the corresponding pattern of anomalies in the geomagnetic potential when the latter is rotated in longitude. Since gravitational anomalies originate at or above the core surface and the magnetic anomalies originate within the core, the correlation, if statistically significant, must be a manifestation of processes occurring at the core-mantle interface and has important implications for the structure and dynamics of the Earth’s deep interior. Indeed, the discovery of the correlation stemmed from considerations of interactions between motions in the core and mantle and can be regarded as evidence in favour of deep mantle convection. The large value for the correlation coefficient is now accepted but, notwithstanding our published statistical tests to the contrary, opinions are often expressed in the literature that any low-order convergent field might be expected to show a high correlation with gravity when rotated to the optimum position.

Therefore, the joint investigation of variations in FCN and GMF can elucidate the Earth's interior and dynamics. In this paper, we investigated the FCN amplitude and phase variations derived from VLBI observations. Comparison of the epochs of the changes in the FCN amplitude and phase with the epochs of the GMJs indicated that the observed extremes in the FCN amplitude and phase variations were closely related to the GMJ epochs. In particular, the FCN amplitude begins to grow one to three years after the GMJs. Thus, processes that cause GMJs are assumed as sources of FCN excitation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","author":[{"family":"Malkin","given":"Z."}],"citation-key":"Malkin2013","container-title":"Journal of Geodynamics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jog.2013.06.001","ISSN":"02643707","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"53-58","publisher":"Elsevier Ltd","title":"Free core nutation and geomagnetic jerks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jog.2013.06.001","volume":"72"},

For rotation rates of geophysical interest all normal modes are stable. The introduction of ohmic dissipation leads to a hydro-magnetic boundary-layer problem. Solutions for the boundary layer are outlined indicating its role in altering the free periods, damping the oscillations and producing external magnetic fields. Dispersion relations are derived which establish that the zonal phase velocities of both ‘fast’ hydrodynamic and ‘slow’ hydro-magnetic waves can be of either sign.

Also, the surface equilibrium temperature of the former is almost twice as sensitive to change of various factors such as solar constant, CO2 content, O3 content, and cloudiness, than that of the latter, due to the adjustment of water vapor content to the temperature variation of the atmosphere. According to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2C.

  {"id":"MarshallEtAl1997","abstract":"The numerical implementation of an ocean model based on the incompressible Navier Stokes equations which is designed for studies of the ocean circulation on horizontal scales less than the depth of the ocean right up to global scale is described. A “pressure correction” method is used which is solved as a Poisson equation for the pressure field with Neumann boundary conditions in a geometry as complicated as that of the ocean basins. A major objective of the study is to make this inversion, and hence nonhydrostatic ocean modeling, efficient on parallel computers. The pressure field is separated into surface, hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic components. First, as in hydrostatic models, a two-dimensional problem is inverted for the surface pressure which is then made use of in the three-dimensional inversion for the nonhydrostatic pressure. Preconditioned conjugate-gradient iteration is used to invert symmetric elliptic operators in both two and three dimensions. Physically motivated preconditioners are designed which are efficient at reducing computation and minimizing communication between processors. Our method exploits the fact that as the horizontal scale of the motion becomes very much larger than the vertical scale, the motion becomes more and more hydrostatic and the three-dimensional Poisson operator becomes increasingly anisotropic and dominated by the vertical axis. Accordingly, a preconditioner is used which, in the hydrostatic limit, is an exact integral of the Poisson operator and so leads to a single algorithm that seamlessly moves from nonhydrostatic to hydrostatic limits. Thus in the hydrostatic limit the model is “fast,” competitive with the fastest ocean climate models in use today based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. But as the resolution is increased, the model dynamics asymptote smoothly to the Navier Stokes equations and so can be used to address small-scale processes. A “finite-volume” approach is employed to discretize the model in space in which property fluxes are defined normal to faces that delineate the volumes. The method makes possible a novel treatment of the boundary in which cells abutting the bottom or coast may take on irregular shapes and be “shaved” to fit the boundary.

The ice giant Neptune played a unique and important role in the process of Solar System formation, has the most meteorologically active atmosphere in the Solar System (despite its great distance from the Sun), and may be the best Solar System analogue of the dominant class of exoplanets detected to date. Neptune's moon Triton is very likely a captured Kuiper Belt object, holding the answers to questions about the icy dwarf planets that formed in the outer Solar System. Triton is geologically active, has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere, and is predicted to have a subsurface ocean. However, our exploration of the Neptune system remains limited to a single spacecraft ﬂyby, made by Voyager 2 in 1989. Here, we present the high-level science case for further exploration of this outermost planetary system, based on a white paper submitted to the European Space Agency (ESA) for the deﬁnition of the second and third large missions in the ESA Cosmic Vision Programme 2015–2025. We discuss all the major science themes that are relevant for further spacecraft exploration of the Neptune system, and identify key scientiﬁc questions in each area.

  {"id":"Mathews2003","abstract":"The coefficients of polar motions of the rigid/nonrigid Earth in frequency bands other than the retrograde diurnal one are systematically computed using general expressions, derived here for the first time, for the prograde and retrograde torques exerted on the Earth by lunisolar potentials of arbitrary spherical harmonic type. Taken together with the already known coefficients of low frequency nutations and UT1 variations, they provide a complete characterization, with high precision, of the motions of the pole of the terrestrial reference frame in space; this is needed for high precision studies in astronomy and space geodesy. The inputs used for our computations are a table of tidal amplitudes, and values of the geopotential coefficients of degrees up to 4 and of other relevant basic Earth parameters. General relations which connect the coefficients of high frequency nutations to those of the equivalent polar motions are established and used for deducing the former. The Chandler resonance plays a significant role in low frequency polar motions. In this context, the role of mantle anelasticity and the nature of the Earth's deformational response to zero frequency forcing are given special consideration. The free core nutation (FCN) resonance of low frequency nutations is shown to affect the prograde semidiurnal nutations through the coupling produced between the nutations in the two frequency bands by triaxiality terms in the angular momenta of the whole Earth and of its fluid core. It is shown in a transparent fashion that the effect of the core triaxiality arises almost exclusively from the huge FCN-related resonance in the wobble of the core. The magnitude of the effect is found to be a few times smaller than reported in a recent paper; it is also found, unlike in that paper, that the changes in the eigenfrequencies due to trixiality are only of the second order in the triaxiality parameter. Numerical results for the polar motions of the nonrigid Earth in different frequency bands, as well as for the elliptical nutations of the rigid Earth, are tabulated and compared with available numbers from earlier works.","author":[{"family":"Mathews","given":"P.

  {"id":"MathisPrat2019","abstract":"<i>Context.<i/> The traditional approximation of rotation (TAR) is a treatment of the dynamical equations of rotating and stably stratified fluids in which the action of the Coriolis acceleration along the direction of the entropy (and chemicals) stratification is neglected, while assuming that the fluid motions are mostly horizontal because of their inhibition in the vertical direction by the buoyancy force. This leads to the neglect of the horizontal projection of the rotation vector in the equations for the dynamics of gravito-inertial waves (GIWs) that become separable, such as in the non-rotating case, while they are not separable in the case in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into account. This approximation, first introduced in geophysical fluid dynamics for thin atmospheres and oceans, has been broadly applied in stellar (and planetary) astrophysics to study low-frequency GIWs that have short vertical wavelengths. The appoximation is now being tested thanks to direct 2D oscillation codes, which constrain its domain of validity. The mathematical flexibility of this treatment allows us to explore broad parameter spaces and to perform detailed seismic modelling of stars.<i>Aims.<i/> The TAR treatment is built on the assumptions that the star is spherical (i.e. its centrifugal deformation is neglected) and uniformly rotating while an adiabatic treatment of the dynamics of the waves is adopted. In addition, their induced gravitational potential fluctuations is neglected. However, it has been recently generalised with including the effects of a differential rotation. We aim to carry out a new generalisation that takes into account the centrifugal acceleration in the case of deformed stars that are moderately and uniformly rotating.<i>Methods.<i/> We construct an analytical expansion of the equations for the dynamics of GIWs in a spheroidal coordinates system by assuming the hierarchies of frequencies and amplitudes of the velocity components adopted within TAR in the spherical case.<i>Results.<i/> We derive the complete set of equations that generalises TAR by taking the centrifugal acceleration into account. As in the case of a differentially rotating spherical star, the problem becomes 2D but can be treated analytically if we assume the anelastic and JWKB approximations, which are relevant for low-frequency GIWs. This allows us to derive a generalised Laplace tidal equation for the horizontal eigenfunctions and asymptotic wave periods, which can be used to probe the structure and dynamics of rotating deformed stars thanks to asteroseismology. A first numerical exploration of its eigenvalues and horizontal eigenfunctions shows their variation as a function of the pseudo-radius for different rotation rates and frequencies and the development of avoided crossings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mathis","given":"S."},{"family":"Prat","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"MathisPrat2019","container-title":"Astronomy & Astrophysics","container-title-short":"A&A","DOI":"10.1051/0004-6361/201935639","ISSN":"0004-6361, 1432-0746","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© S.

The nonaxisymmetric magnetism is initially built in the convection zone and then diffusively imprints downward, similar to the proposed fast magnetic conﬁnement scenario by the Sun’s cyclic dynamo ﬁeld.

  {"id":"Matsushima2020","abstract":"The electrical conductivity of the Earth’s core is an important physical parameter that controls the core dynamics and the thermal evolution of the Earth. In this study, the effect of core electrical conductivity on core surface flow models is investigated. Core surface flow is derived from a geomagnetic field model on the presumption that a viscous boundary layer forms at the core–mantle boundary. Inside the boundary layer, where the viscous force plays an important role in force balance, temporal variations of the magnetic field are caused by magnetic diffusion as well as motional induction. Below the boundary layer, where core flow is assumed to be in tangentially geostrophic balance or tangentially magnetostrophic balance, contributions of magnetic diffusion to temporal variation of the magnetic field are neglected. Under the constraint that the core flow is tangentially geostrophic beneath the boundary layer, the core electrical conductivity in the range from $${10}^{5} ~\\mathrm{S}~{\\mathrm{m}}^{-1}$$ 10 5 S m - 1 to $${10}^{7}~ \\mathrm{S}~{\\mathrm{m}}^{-1}$$ 10 7 S m - 1 has less significant effect on the core flow. Under the constraint that the core flow is tangentially magnetostrophic beneath the boundary layer, the influence of electrical conductivity on the core flow models can be clearly recognized; the magnitude of the mean toroidal flow does not increase or decrease, but that of the mean poloidal flow increases with an increase in core electrical conductivity. This difference arises from the Lorentz force, which can be stronger than the Coriolis force, for higher electrical conductivity, since the Lorentz force is proportional to the electrical conductivity. In other words, the Elsasser number, which represents the ratio of the Lorentz force to the Coriolis force, has an influence on the difference. The result implies that the ratio of toroidal to poloidal flow magnitudes has been changing in accordance with secular changes of rotation rate of the Earth and of core electrical conductivity due to a decrease in core temperature throughout the thermal evolution of the Earth.","author":[{"family":"Matsushima","given":"Masaki"}],"citation-key":"Matsushima2020","container-title":"Earth, Planets and Space","DOI":"10.1186/s40623-020-01269-0","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3106571765\nS2ID: 0e1b219f860966c4b47751e83df12a152b9b2859","page":"1-11","title":"Effect of core electrical conductivity on core surface flow models","type":"article-journal","volume":"72"},

Instabilities of these waves, such as triadic resonant instability (TRI), may play a key role in the mixing process of the deep ocean. In an experimental set-up, we generate inertia–gravity waves which may become unstable depending on the background rotation and wave frequency. The instability produces secondary waves that match the spatial and temporal resonance conditions of TRI. The effect of rotation is introduced in a pre-existing theory and results in a prediction of the growth rate of TRI in the case of an infinite plane wave. The issue of finite size of the beam is then addressed using a simple model in which we show that the instability is enhanced in a given range of Coriolis parameter. Finally, we compare the experimental threshold of the instability with the model, and find good agreement except at higher rotation rate.

The operators governing the eigenproblem are, in general, nonlinear in the eigenvalue and non-self-adjoint, which makes the repeated solution of the eigenvalue problem (necessary, for example, when the effect of several parameter values on the system needs to be assessed) expensive. This study reviews the adjoint-based incremental procedure for calculating the coefficients of power series expansions of simple (non-degenerate) eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. These expansions approximate the eigenvalues to any desired order in a finite region. An efficient numerical implementation of the theory is proposed, and it is shown how high-order power series approximations of the eigenvalues give very accurate results within the radius of convergence of the power series, which is finite and generally not small. Furthermore, the domain of convergence of the power series might be extended by considering Padé expansions of the eigenvalues.

In this paper we assess the detectability of those modes by injecting numerically generated post-merger waveforms into colored Gaussian noise of second-generation and future detectors. Signals are recovered using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that reconstructs them through a morphology-independent approach using series of sine-Gaussian wavelets.

  {"id":"MiriAlu2019","abstract":"Exceptional points are branch point singularities in the parameter space of a system at which two or more eigenvalues, and their corresponding eigenvectors, coalesce and become degenerate. Such peculiar degeneracies are distinct features of non-Hermitian systems, which do not obey conservation laws because they exchange energy with the surrounding environment. Non-Hermiticity has been of great interest in recent years, particularly in connection with the quantum mechanical notion of parity-time symmetry, after the realization that Hamiltonians satisfying this special symmetry can exhibit entirely real spectra. These concepts have become of particular interest in photonics because optical gain and loss can be integrated and controlled with high resolution in nanoscale structures, realizing an ideal playground for non-Hermitian physics, parity-time symmetry, and exceptional points. As we control dissipation and amplification in a nanophotonic system, the emergence of exceptional point singularities dramatically alters their overall response, leading to a range of exotic optical functionalities associated with abrupt phase transitions in the eigenvalue spectrum. These concepts enable ultrasensitive measurements, superior manipulation of the modal content of multimode lasers, and adiabatic control of topological energy transfer for mode and polarization conversion. Non-Hermitian degeneracies have also been exploited in exotic laser systems, new nonlinear optics schemes, and exotic scattering features in open systems. Here we review the opportunities offered by exceptional point physics in photonics, discuss recent developments in theoretical and experimental research based on photonic exceptional points, and examine future opportunities in this area from basic science to applied technology.","author":[{"family":"Miri","given":"Mohammad Ali"},{"family":"Alù","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"MiriAlu2019","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aar7709","ISSN":"10959203","issue":"6422","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"PMID":"30606818","title":"Exceptional points in optics and photonics","type":"article-journal","volume":"363"},

  {"id":"MitrovicaEtAl2015","abstract":"In 2002, Munk defined an important enigma of 20th century global mean sea-level (GMSL) rise that has yet to be resolved. First, he listed three canonical observations related to Earth’s rotation [(i) the slowing of Earth’s rotation rate over the last three millennia inferred from ancient eclipse observations, and changes in the (ii) amplitude and (iii) orientation of Earth’s rotation vector over the last century estimated from geodetic and astronomic measurements] and argued that they could all be fit by a model of ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) associated with the last ice age. Second, he demonstrated that prevailing estimates of the 20th century GMSL rise (~1.5 to 2.0 mm/year), after correction for the maximum signal from ocean thermal expansion, implied mass flux from ice sheets and glaciers at a level that would grossly misfit the residual GIA-corrected observations of Earth’s rotation. We demonstrate that the combination of lower estimates of the 20th century GMSL rise (up to 1990) improved modeling of the GIA process and that the correction of the eclipse record for a signal due to angular momentum exchange between the fluid outer core and the mantle reconciles all three Earth rotation observations. This resolution adds confidence to recent estimates of individual contributions to 20th century sea-level change and to projections of GMSL rise to the end of the 21st century based on them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Mitrovica","given":"Jerry X."},{"family":"Hay","given":"Carling C."},{"family":"Morrow","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Kopp","given":"Robert E."},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"Sabine"}],"citation-key":"MitrovicaEtAl2015","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Sci.

  {"id":"MonvilleEtAl2019","abstract":"In planetary ﬂuid cores, the density depends on temperature and chemical composition, which diffuse at very different rates. This leads to various instabilities, bearing the name of double-diffusive convection. We investigate rotating double-diffusive convection (RDDC) in ﬂuid spheres. We use the Boussinesq approximation with homogeneous internal thermal and compositional source terms. We focus on the ﬁnger regime, in which the thermal gradient is stabilising whereas the compositional one is destabilising. First, we perform a global linear stability analysis in spheres. The critical Rayleigh numbers drastically drop for stably stratiﬁed ﬂuids, yielding large-scale convective motions where local analyses predict stability. We evidence the inviscid nature of this large-scale double-diffusive instability, enabling the determination of the marginal stability curve at realistic planetary regimes. In particular, we show that in stably stratiﬁed spheres, the Rayleigh numbers Ra at the onset evolve like Ra ∼ Ek−1, where Ek is the Ekman number. This differs from rotating convection in unstably stratiﬁed spheres, for which Ra ∼ Ek−4/3. The domain of existence of inviscid convection thus increases as Ek−1/3. Second, we perform nonlinear simulations. We ﬁnd a transition between two regimes of RDDC, controlled by the strength of the stratiﬁcation. Furthermore, far from the RDDC onset, we ﬁnd a dominating equatorially anti-symmetric, large-scale zonal ﬂow slightly above the associated linear onset. Unexpectedly, a purely linear mechanism can explain this phenomenon, even far from the instability onset, yielding a symmetry breaking of the nonlinear ﬂow at saturation. For even stronger stable stratiﬁcation, the ﬂow becomes mainly equatorially-symmetric and intense zonal jets develop. Finally, we apply our results to the early Earth core. Double diffusion can reduce the critical Rayleigh number by four decades for realistic core conditions. We suggest that the early Earth core was prone to turbulent RDDC, with large-scale zonal ﬂows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Monville","given":"Rémy"},{"family":"Vidal","given":"Jérémie"},{"family":"Cébron","given":"David"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Nathanaël"}],"citation-key":"MonvilleEtAl2019","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggz347","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"Supplement_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"S195-S218","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Rotating double-diffusive convection in stably stratified planetary cores","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08523","volume":"219"},

An orbiting spacecraft using an altimeter for crossover analysis and Doppler tracking from Earth should be able to achieve sufficient accuracy to identify the tidal amplitude to within about a meter over the course of a few months (observing tens of tidal cycles).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"William B."},{"family":"Schubert","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"MooreSchubert2003","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2003.07.001","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11,1]]},"page":"223-226","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The tidal response of Ganymede and Callisto with and without liquid water oceans","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350300215X","volume":"166"},
  {"id":"MoraEtAl2021","abstract":"We analyze theoretically and experimentally the triadic resonance instability (TRI) of a plane inertial wave in a rotating fluid. Building on the classical triadic interaction equations between helical modes, we show by numerical integration that the maximum growth rate of the TRI is found for secondary waves that do not propagate in the same vertical plane as the primary wave (the rotation axis is parallel to the vertical). In the inviscid limit, we prove this result analytically, in which case the change in the horizontal propagation direction induced by the TRI evolves from 60∘ to 90∘ depending on the frequency of the primary wave. Due to a wave generator with a large spatial extension in the horizontal direction of invariance of the forced wave, we are able to report experimental evidence that the TRI of a plane inertial wave is three dimensional. The wave vectors of the secondary waves produced by the TRI are shown to match the theoretical predictions based on the maximum growth rate criterion. These results reveal that the triadic resonant interactions between inertial waves are very efficient at redistributing energy in the horizontal plane, normal to the rotation axis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mora","given":"Daniel Odens"},{"family":"Monsalve","given":"Eduardo"},{"family":"Brunet","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Dauxois","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Cortet","given":"Pierre-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"MoraEtAl2021","container-title":"Physical Review Fluids","container-title-short":"Phys.

  {"id":"MoshagenEtAl2018","abstract":"Many negatively connoted personality traits (often termed “dark traits”) have been introduced to account for ethically, morally, and socially questionable behavior. Herein, we provide a unifying, comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding dark personality in terms of a general dispositional tendency of which dark traits arise as specific manifestations. That is, we theoretically specify the common core of dark traits, which we call the Dark Factor of Personality (D). The fluid concept of D captures individual differences in the tendency to maximize one’s individual utility—disregarding, accepting, or malevolently provoking disutility for others—accompanied by beliefs that serve as justifications. To critically test D, we unify and extend prior work methodologically and empirically by considering a large number of dark traits simultaneously, using statistical approaches tailored to capture both the common core and the unique content of dark traits, and testing the predictive validity of both D and the unique content of dark traits with respect to diverse criteria including fully consequential and incentive-compatible behavior. In a series of four studies (N > 2,500), we provide evidence in support of the theoretical conceptualization of D, show that dark traits can be understood as specific manifestations of D, demonstrate that D predicts a multitude of criteria in the realm of ethically, morally, and socially questionable behavior, and illustrate that D does not depend on any particular indicator variable included.

  {"id":"Mound2005","abstract":"Motion of the rotation axis of the Earth contains decadal variations with amplitudes on the order of 10 mas. The origin of these decadal polar motions is unknown. A class of rotational normal modes of the core-mantle system termed torsional oscillations are known to affect the length of day (LOD) at decadal periods and have also been suggested as a possible excitation source for the observed decadal polar motion. Torsional oscillations involve relative motion between the outer core and the surrounding solid bodies, producing electromagnetic torques at the inner-core boundary (ICB) and core-mantle boundary (CMB). It has been proposed that the ICB torque can explain the excitation of the approximately 30-yr-period polar motion termed the Markowitz wobble. This paper uses the results of a torsional oscillation model to calculate the torques generated at Markowitz and other decadal periods and finds, in contrast to previous results, that electromagnetic torques at the ICB can not explain the observed polar motion. © 2004 RAS.","author":[{"family":"Mound","given":"Jon E."}],"citation-key":"Mound2005","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02495.x","ISSN":"0956540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"721-728","title":"Electromagnetic torques in the core and resonant excitation of decadal polar motion","type":"article-journal","volume":"160"},

  {"id":"MunkWunsch1998","abstract":"Without deep mixing, the ocean would turn, within a few thousand years, into a stagnant pool of cold salty water with equilibrium maintained locally by near-surface mixing and with very weak convectively driven surface-intensified circulation. (This result follows from Sandström’s theorem for a fluid heated and cooled at the surface.) In this context we revisit the 1966 “Abyssal Recipes”, which called for a diapycnal diffusivity of 10-4m2/s (1cgs) to maintain the abyssal stratification against global upwelling associated with 25Sverdrups of deep water formation. Subsequent microstructure measurements gave a pelagic diffusivity (away from topography) of 10-5m2/s — a low value confirmed by dye release experiments. A new solution (without restriction to constant coefficients) leads to approximately the same values of global upwelling and diffusivity, but we reinterpret the computed diffusivity as a surrogate for a small number of concentrated sources of buoyancy flux (regions of intense mixing) from which the water masses (but not the turbulence) are exported into the ocean interior. Using the Levitus climatology we find that 2.1TW (terawatts) are required to maintain the global abyssal density distribution against 30Sverdrups of deep water formation. The winds and tides are the only possible source of mechanical energy to drive the interior mixing. Tidal dissipation is known from astronomy to equal 3.7 TW (2.50±0.05TW from M2 alone), but nearly all of this has traditionally been allocated to dissipation in the turbulent bottom boundary layers of marginal seas. However, two recent TOPEX/POSEIDON altimetric estimates combined with dynamical models suggest that 0.6–0.9TW may be available for abyssal mixing. A recent estimate of wind-driving suggests 1TW of additional mixing power. All values are very uncertain. A surprising conclusion is that the equator-to-pole heat flux of 2000TW associated with the meridional overturning circulation would not exist without the comparatively minute mechanical mixing sources. Coupled with the findings that mixing occurs at a few dominant sites, there is a host of questions concerning the maintenance of the present climate state, but also that of paleoclimates and their relation to detailed continental configurations, the history of the Earth–Moon system, and a possible great sensitivity to details of the wind system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Munk","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Wunsch","given":"Carl"}],"citation-key":"MunkWunsch1998","container-title":"Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers","container-title-short":"Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers","DOI":"10.1016/S0967-0637(98)00070-3","ISSN":"0967-0637","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",12,1]]},"page":"1977-2010","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing","title-short":"Abyssal recipes II","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063798000703","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"NakajimaEtAl2019","abstract":"The formation and orbital evolution of Saturn's inner mid-sized moons – Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, and Mimas – are still debated. The most puzzling aspects are 1) how the Tethys–Dione pair and the Mimas–Enceladus pair passed through their strong 3:2 mean-motion resonances during the tidal orbital evolution, and 2) the current strong heat flow from Enceladus, which is a few orders of magnitude higher than the tidal energy dissipation caused by the present orbital eccentricity of Enceladus. Here we perform N-body simulations of the moons’ orbital evolution from various initial conditions – assuming that the moons were formed from Saturn's hypothetical massive ring – and investigate possible paths to solve the above difficulties. If the moons remain on nearly circular orbits and the influence of the rings is neglected, we find that the Tethys–Dione pair cannot avoid becoming trapped in the 2:1 and 3:2 mean-motion resonances as they recede from Saturn, and that the Tethys–Enceladus pair cannot avoid collisions after the resonance trapping, in case Saturn's quality factor is smaller than 15,000. These findings are inconsistent with the current orbital configuration. However, taking into account both the eccentricity excitation and the orbital expansion caused by the ring torque, we find that these resonance captures are avoided. With the relatively high eccentricity pumped up by the torque, Enceladus passes through all the mean-motion resonances with Tethys, and the Dione–Tethys pair passes through their 2:1 resonance and possibly the 3:2 resonance as well. After Enceladus resides beyond the 2:1 resonance with the outer ring edge, the eccentricity can be tidally damped. While this is a promising path of evolution, in most runs, Enceladus collides with Tethys by the excited eccentricity. There is a hint that a ring mass decrease (possibly due to Mimas formation) could avoid the collision between Enceladus and Tethys. The parameter survey taking into account detailed ring evolution and Mimas is left for future study. The heat that was tidally dissipated due to the eccentricity excitation by the ring torque in the past is stored in the moons and slowly radiated away through conductive transfer. The stored heat in Enceladus may account for the current anomalously high heat flow.","author":[{"family":"Nakajima","given":"Ayano"},{"family":"Ida","given":"Shigeru"},{"family":"Kimura","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Brasser","given":"Ramon"}],"citation-key":"NakajimaEtAl2019","container-title":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2018.08.030","ISBN":"1477-9072","ISSN":"10902643","issue":"August 2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"570-582","PMID":"26524498","publisher":"Elsevier","title":"Orbital evolution of Saturn's mid-sized moons and the tidal heating of Enceladus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.08.030","volume":"317"},

The constitutive relations for the polarization, the electric displacement, the magnetic intensity, and the total stress are found to contain linear terms proportional to either the spontaneous polarization PS or the spontaneous electic field ES. The terms involving PS are found to cancel from the differential equations and boundary conditions when PS is homogeneous. If PS is not homogeneous, linear terms proportional to spatial derivatives of PS remain in the Maxwell equations. The terms involving ES lead to a new effective piezoelectric stress tensor of lower symmetry than the normal piezoelectric stress tensor, because it can couple to rotation as well as to strain. The terms involving ES also produce a new effective elastic stiffness tensor of lower symmetry than the usual stiffness tensor in that it can couple to both strain and rotations.

  {"id":"Neubauer1998","abstract":"Recent observations by the Galileo spacecraft and Earth-based techniques have motivated us to reconsider the sub-Alfvénic interaction between the Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the magnetosphere. (1) We show that the atomic processes causing the interaction between the magnetoplasma and a neutral atmosphere can be described by generalized collision frequencies with contributions from elastic collisions, ion pickup, etc. Thus there is no fundamental difference in the effect of these processes on the plasma dynamics claimed in the recent literature. For a magnetic field configuration including possible internal fields, we show that the sub-Alfvénic, low-beta interaction can be described by an anisotropically conducting atmosphere joined to an Alfvén wing as one extreme case and the Jovian ionosphere as the other extreme case. (2) The addition of a small magnetic field of internal origin does not modify the general Alfvén wing model qualitatively but only quantitatively. All magnetic moments discussed in the literature for Io are small in this sense. For an aligned internal dipole and ambient Jovian magnetic field the interaction will be enhanced by focusing of the electric field. (3) A qualitative change occurs by the additional occurrence of closed magnetic field lines for larger internal magnetic fields as in the case of Ganymede. Here the focusing is even enhanced. (4) The first discussion of nonstationary plasma flows at the satellites shows that electromagnetically induced magnetic fields may play an important role if the satellite interiors are highly conducting. From the point of view of the external excitation, induction effects may be strong for Callisto, Io, Europa, and Ganymede in order of decreasing importance. The magnetic field observations at the first Callisto encounter can be explained by these effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Neubauer","given":"Fritz M."}],"citation-key":"Neubauer1998","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","DOI":"10.1029/97JE03370","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"E9","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union.","page":"19843-19866","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The sub-Alfvénic interaction of the Galilean satellites with the Jovian magnetosphere","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/97JE03370","volume":"103"},
  {"id":"NicolasBuffett2023","abstract":"Recent geomagnetic observations reveal localized oscillations in the field’s secular acceleration at high latitudes, with periods of about 20 yr. Several types of waves in rotating magnetized fluids have been proposed to explain equatorial oscillations with similar high frequencies. Among these are non-axisymmetric Alfvén waves, magneto-Coriolis waves and, in the presence of fluid stratification, magnetic-Archimedes–Coriolis (MAC) waves. We explore the hypothesis that the observed high latitude patterns are the signature of MAC waves by modelling their generation in Earth’s core. We quantitatively assess several generation mechanisms using output from dynamo simulations in a theoretical framework due to Lighthill. While the spatio-temporal structure of the sources from the dynamo simulations are expected to be realistic, their amplitudes are extrapolated to reflect differences between the simulation’s parameter space and Earth-like conditions. We estimate full wave spectra spanning monthly to centennial frequencies for three plausible excitation sources: thermal fluctuations, Lorentz force and magnetic induction. When focusing on decadal frequencies, the Lorentz force appears to be most effective in generating high-latitude MAC waves with amplitude estimates falling within an order of magnitude of observed oscillations. Overall, this study puts forward MAC waves as a viable explanation, in the presence of fluid stratification at the top of Earth’s core, for observed field variations at high latitudes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Nicolas","given":"Quentin"},{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"NicolasBuffett2023","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggad047","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,1]]},"page":"1961-1973","source":"Silverchair","title":"Excitation of high-latitude MAC waves in Earth’s core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad047","volume":"233"},

Two major puzzles are the source of the observed heat, and how the ocean could have been maintained. Tidal dissipation in Enceladus is ultimately controlled by the rate of dissipation within Saturn, parameterized by the factor Qp. A Qp of about 2,000 is indicated by astrometric measurements and generates an equilibrium heating rate at Enceladus sufficient to explain the observed heat and maintain an ocean indefinitely if the ice shell is conductive. If constant, this Qp would indicate an age for Enceladus much less than that of the solar system. An alternative, however, termed the \" resonance-locking \" scenario, is that the effective Qp is time-variable such that the heating rate is almost constant over geological time.

  {"id":"Noir2003","abstract":"The Poincare flow (also known as the tilt-over mode) in a precessing cavity filled with water is investigated experimentally. Assuming that the flow is mainly a solid-body rotation, we have used three independent techniques to determine this rotation: introduction of light ceramic particles to materialize the fluid rotation axis, pressure measurements at the cavity wall, and ultrasonic Doppler anenometry. With the latter technique, we determine the angle between the solid body rotation vector and the cavity axis indirectly, through the secondary flow - oblique shear layers which are stationary in a frame rotating at the precession rate - that the differential rotation at the boundary induces within the fluid. Rapid changes in the direction of the axis of rotation of the fluid for critical values of the rate of precession and of the rate of rotation are demonstrated. In some cases, the inclination of the fluid rotation vector with respect to the cavity axis much exceeds the inclination of the prescribed precession vector. A torque approach, which can be generalized, shows that this effect is due to a non-linear resonance between the frequencies of the Poincare mode and of precession. As a result, we can determine the validity domain of current models of precession and nutations of planets enclosing a fluid core.","author":[{"family":"Noir","given":"J."},{"family":"Cardin","given":"P."},{"family":"Jault","given":"D."},{"family":"Masson","given":"J.

When these systems experience periodic forcing, for example of tidal origin, the response of the fluid can become localized in the neighbourhood of a wave attractor. In this paper I define a prototypical problem of this form and construct analytically the long-term response to a periodic body force in the asymptotic limit of small viscosity. The vorticity of the fluid is localized in a detached shear layer close to the wave attractor in such a way that the total rate of dissipation of energy is asymptotically independent of the viscosity.

This problem may be regarded as a simplified model of astrophysical tides in convective regions of stars and giant planets. The response can be separated into non-wavelike and wavelike parts, where the former is related instantaneously to the tidal potential and the latter may involve resonances or other singularities. The imaginary part of the potential Love number of the body, which is directly related to the rates of energy and angular momentum exchange in the tidal interaction and to the rate of dissipation of energy, may have a complicated dependence on the tidal frequency. However, a certain frequency average of this quantity is independent of the dissipative properties of the fluid and can be determined by means of an impulse calculation. The result is a strongly increasing function of the size of the core when the tidal potential is a sectoral harmonic, especially when the body is not strongly centrally condensed. However, the same is not true for tesseral harmonics, which receive a richer response and may therefore be important in determining tidal evolution even though they are usually subdominant in the expansion of the tidal potential. We also discuss analytically the low-frequency response of a slowly rotating homogeneous fluid body to tidal potentials proportional to spherical harmonics of degrees less than five. Tesseral harmonics of degrees greater than two, such as are present in the case of a spin-orbit misalignment, can resonate with inertial modes of the full sphere, leading to an enhanced tidal interaction.","author":[{"family":"Ogilvie","given":"Gordon I."}],"citation-key":"Ogilvie2013","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/sts362","ISBN":"0000000000000","ISSN":"00358711","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"613-632","PMID":"26928661","title":"Tides in rotating barotropic fluid bodies: The contribution of inertial waves and the role of internal structure","type":"article-journal","volume":"429"},

  {"id":"OgilvieLin2003","abstract":"[Abridged] Tides may play an important role in determining the observed distributions of mass, orbital period, and eccentricity of the extrasolar planets. In addition, tidal interactions between giant planets in the solar system and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migration of the satellites, leading to their capture into resonant configurations. We treat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining the efficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets. In cases of interest, the tidal forcing frequencies are comparable to the spin frequency of the planet but small compared to its dynamical frequency. We therefore study the linearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet to low-frequency tidal forcing. Convective regions of the planet support inertial waves, while any radiative regions support generalized Hough waves. We present illustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate and argue that inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation in most cases of interest. The resulting value of Q depends in a highly erratic way on the forcing frequency, but we provide evidence that the relevant frequency-averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of the viscosity in the limit of small Ekman number. In short-period extrasolar planets, if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of a radiative outer layer that supports generalized Hough modes, the tidal dissipation rate can be enhanced through the excitation and damping of these waves.

  {"id":"Ojakangas1986","abstract":"A simple model of the coupled thermal and orbital evolution of a tidally heated satellite in an orbital resonance is presented and applied specifically to Io. The model quantitatively demonstrates how a feedback mechanism between the orbital and thermal energy of such a satellite can lead to periodic variations in surface heatflow and orbital eccentricity. The convective heatflow and (k/Q) of the satellite are parameterized as local power laws of the temperature, where Q is the quality factor and k is the second-degree tidal potential Love number. The time evolution of the model is determined by two nonlinear equations: an equation governing the orbital eccentricity, and a simple heat-balance equation determining the temperature. A linear stability analysis reveals that the time-independent solution is unstable if n > m + p, where n and m are the exponents in the power laws for (k/Q) and convective heatflow, respectively, and p is the ratio of the convective cooling time scale to the time scale for equilibration of the eccentricity. Numerical integration of the nonlinear equations reveals behavior in qualitative agreement with this relation. Laboratory data on near-solidus peridotites suggest 20 ≲ n ≲ 30 and parameterized convection schemes suggest m ∼ 10. Since p is of order unity, it follows that tidally heated satellites are probably in the unstable regime if they are operating near the solidus. It is thus probable that Io has no thermal steady state. The model is made more realistic by (1) arresting the reduction of (k/Q) at low temperature, and (2) arresting the growth of temperature at the mantle solidus and allowing volcanism to remove the excess heat. When the second modification is included, the unstable regime becomes periodic. In addition, a global k substantially larger than the elastic value is possible for a mostly solid Io because the body may begin to behave viscously when the tidal period is longer than or comparable to the Maxwell time. This requires a solid-state viscosity of ≲4 × 1015Pa sec, which may be achievable with a small amount of partial melt. The model can easily be adjusted to pass through Io's current observed heatflow (1-2 W m-2) and eccentricity (∼0.004) for reasonable choices of parameters (Q/k)min∼ 100, (Q/k)max∼ few × 103, solidus viscosity ∼1015-1017Pa sec, and QJwithin the required dynamical bounds. The periods of high heatflow and acceptable eccentricity typically have durations of ∼20-30 myr, separated in time by ∼80-100 myr. Spatial heterogeneities in Io's thermal structure are likely to make the behavior more complicated.

We build a rotational dynamic model of the Cassini state of the Moon that comprises an inner core, a ﬂuid core and a mantle, and where solid regions are allowed to deform viscoelastically in response to an applied forcing. We show that the presence of an inner core does not change the global monthly Q of the Moon and hence, that the contribution from solid-body tides to φp is largely unaﬀected by an inner core. However, we also show that viscoelastic deformation within the inner core, acting to realign its ﬁgure axis with that of the mantle, can contribute signiﬁcantly to φp through inner coremantle gravitational coupling. We show that the contribution to φp is largest when the inner core viscosity is in the range of 1013 to 1014 Pa s, when the inner core radius is large and when the free inner core nutation frequency approaches a resonance with the precession frequency of 2π/18.6 yr−1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Organowski","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"OrganowskiDumberry2020","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"OuazzaniEtAl2012","abstract":"Context. Very high precision seismic space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler provide the means of testing the modeling of transport processes in stellar interiors. For some stars, such as solar-like and red giant stars, a rotational splitting is measured. However, to fully exploit these splittings and constrain the rotation profile, one needs to be able to calculate them accurately. For some other stars, such as delta Scuti and Be stars, for instance, the observed pulsation spectra are modified by rotation to such an extent that a perturbative treatment of the effects of rotation is no longer valid. Aims: We present here a new two-dimensional non-perturbative code called ACOR (adiabatic code of oscillation including rotation) that allows us to compute adiabatic non-radial pulsations of rotating stars without making any assumptions on the sphericity of the star, the fluid properties (i.e., baroclinicity) or the rotation profile. Methods: The 2D non-perturbative calculations fully take into account the centrifugal distortion of the star and include the full influence of the Coriolis acceleration. The numerical method is based on a spectral approach for the angular part of the modes and a fourth-order finite differences approach for the radial part. Results: We test and evaluate the accuracy of the calculations by comparing them with those coming from the TOP (two-dimensional oscillation program) for the same polytropic models. We illustrate the effects of rapid rotation on stellar pulsations through the phenomenon of avoided crossings. Conclusions: As shown by the comparison with the TOP for simple models, the code is stable, and gives accurate results up to near-critical rotation rates.","author":[{"family":"Ouazzani","given":"R.-M."},{"family":"Dupret","given":"M.-A."},{"family":"Reese","given":"D.

  {"id":"OuazzaniEtAl2020","abstract":"Gamma Doradus stars present an incredibly rich pulsation spectra, with gravito-inertial modes, in some cases supplemented with delta Scuti-like pressure modes and in numerous cases with Rossby modes. The present paper aims at showing that, in addition to these modes established in the radiative envelope, pure inertial modes, trapped in the convective core, can be detected in Kepler observations of gamma Doradus stars, thanks to their resonance with the gravito-inertial modes. We start by using a simplified model of perturbations in a full sphere of uniform density. Under these conditions, the spectrum of pure inertial modes is known from analytical solutions of the so-called Poincare equation. We then compute coupling factors which help select the pure inertial modes which interact best with the surrounding dipolar gravito-inertial modes. Using complete calculations of gravito-inertial modes in realistic models of gamma Doradus stars, we are able to show that the pure inertial/gravito-inertial resonances appear as dips in the gravito-inertial mode period spacing series at spin parameters close to those predicted by the simple model. We find the first evidence of such dips in the Kepler gamma Doradus star KIC5608334. Finally, using complete calculations in isolated convective cores, we find that the spin parameters of the pure inertial/gravito-inertial resonances are also sensitive to the density stratification of the convective core. In conclusion, we have discovered that certain dips in gravito-inertial mode period spacings observed in some Kepler stars are in fact the signatures of resonances with pure-inertial modes that are trapped in the convective core. This holds the promise to finally access the central conditions , i.e. rotation and density stratification, of intermediate-mass stars on the main sequence.","author":[{"family":"Ouazzani","given":"R-M."},{"family":"Lignières","given":"F."},{"family":"Dupret","given":"M-A."},{"family":"Salmon","given":"S.

  {"id":"Patocka2021","abstract":"Almost three decades ago, the problem of long term polar wander on a dynamic planet was formulated and simplified within the framework of normal mode theory. The underlying simplifications have been debated ever since, recently in a series of papers by Hu et al. 2017a, 2017b, and 2019, who clarify the role of neglecting short-term relaxation modes of the body. However, the authors still do not solve the governing equations in full, because they make approximations to the Liouville equation (LE). In this paper I use a time domain approach and for previously studied test loads I solve both the relaxation of the body and the LE in full. I also compute the energy balance of true polar wander (TPW) in order to analyze the existing LE approximations. For fast rotating bodies such as the Earth, I show that the rotation axis is always aligned with the maximum principal axis of inertia (w||MMOI) once free oscillations are damped. The w||MMOI assumption is also re-derived theoretically. Contrary to previous beliefs, I demonstrate that it is not necessarily linked to the quasi-fluid simplification of the body's viscoelastic response to loading and rotation, but that it is an expression of neglecting the Coriolis and Euler forces in the equation of motion. For slowly rotating bodies such as Venus, the full LE together with energy analysis indicate that previous estimates of TPW in the normal direction need to be revisited.

  {"id":"PatockaEtAl2018","abstract":"Understanding the feedback between the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and the Earth's rotation is important for an accurate prediction of sea level changes induced by climate and tectonic processes. Here we consider a simple, four-layer incompressible Earth model, recently used for a benchmark of GIA codes to estimate the accuracy of the linearized Liouville equation (LE) and to demonstrate that models with an incomplete or missing rotational feedback violate the principle of energy conservation. First, we compute GIA on a rotating Earth by solving the equation of motion coupled with LE in its full nonlinear form. By comparing the nonlinear LE solution with the traditional linearized one, we find that the radial component of the angular velocity vector is inaccurate in the latter case, with an error exceeding 10 per cent already after 1 kyr of evolution. To understand the cause of this discrepancy, we investigate the time evolution of different kinds of energy involved in the process. While the rotational, elastic and dissipative energies are straightforward to compute, the formula for the gravitational energy contains an integral that requires a careful, higher-order accurate evaluation of the gravitational potential perturbation.We circumvent this problem by transforming the integral into a different one, formulated in terms of displacement instead of potential. We find that the solution of the linearized LE equation does not conserve the energy, since, in the linearized case, the rate of change of the rotational energy is not equal to the power of the centrifugal force. We also compute the energy balance of GIA on a constantly rotating Earth, and demonstrate the importance of the rotational feedback in the equation of motion. The formalism derived in this study allows a detailed examination of the energy balance for a rotating, incompressible planetary body deformed by a surface load. As such, it may not only serve as a reliable tool for a posteriori testing of GIA numerical solutions but it can also be used in different planetary science applications.","author":[{"family":"Patočka","given":"V."},{"family":"Čadek","given":"O."},{"family":"Martinec","given":"Z."}],"citation-key":"PatockaEtAl2018","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggx469","ISSN":"1365246X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"955-975","title":"Energy balance of glacial isostatic adjustment: Importance of the rotational feedback","type":"article-journal","volume":"212"},

The conditions for detecting the signature of the molten core are that such a core not follow the 88-day physical libration of the mantle induced by periodic solar torques, but that it does follow the 250 000-year precession of the spin axis that tracks the orbit precession within a Cassini spin state. These conditions are easily satisfied if the coupling between the liquid core and solid mantle is viscous in nature. The alternative coupling mechanisms of pressure forces on irregularities in the core-mantle boundary (CMB), gravitational torques between an axially asymmetric mantle and an assumed axially asymmetric solid inner core, and magnetic coupling between the conducting molten core and a conducting layer in the mantle at the CMB are shown for a reasonable range of assumptions not to frustrate the first condition while making the second condition more secure. Simulations have shown that the combination of spacecraft tracking and laser altimetry during the planned MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, Ranging) orbiter mission to Mercury will determine C20, C22, and θ to better than 1% and φ0 to better than 8%—sufficient precision to distinguish a molten core and constrain its size. The possible determination of the latter two parameters to 1% or less with Earth-based radar experiments and MESSENGER determination of C20 and C22 to 0.1% would lead to a maximum uncertainty in the ratio of the moment of inertia of the mantle to that of the whole planet, Cm/C, of ˜2% with comparable precision in characterizing the extent of the molten core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Peale","given":"Stanton J."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Roger J."},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Sean C."},{"family":"Smith","given":"David E."},{"family":"Zuber","given":"Maria T."}],"citation-key":"PealeEtAl2002","container-title":"Meteoritics & Planetary Science","DOI":"10.1111/j.1945-5100.2002.tb00895.x","ISSN":"1945-5100","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"language":"en","page":"1269-1283","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A procedure for determining the nature of Mercury's core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1945-5100.2002.tb00895.x","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"PealeEtAl2014","abstract":"The rotational evolution of Mercury’s mantle plus crust and its core under conservative and dissipative torques is important for understanding the planet’s spin state. Dissipation results from tidal torques and viscous, magnetic, and topographic torques contributed by interactions between the liquid core and solid mantle. For a spherically symmetric core–mantle boundary (CMB), the system goes to an equilibrium state wherein the spin axes of the mantle and core are ﬁxed in the frame precessing with the orbit, and in which the mantle and core are differentially rotating. This equilibrium exhibits a mantle spin axis that is offset from the Cassini state by larger amounts for weaker core–mantle coupling for all three dissipative core–mantle coupling mechanisms, and the spin axis of the core is separated farther from that of the mantle, leading to larger differential rotation. Relatively strong core–mantle coupling is necessary to bring the mantle spin axis to a position within the uncertainty in its observed position, which is close to the Cassini state deﬁned for a completely solid Mercury. Strong core–mantle coupling means that Mercury’s response is closer to that of a solid planet. Measured or inferred values of parameters in all three core–mantle coupling mechanisms for a spherically symmetric CMB appear not to accomplish this requirement. For a hydrostatic ellipsoidal CMB, pressure coupling dominates the dissipative effects on the mantle and core positions, and dissipation with pressure coupling brings the mantle spin solidly to the Cassini state. The core spin goes to a position displaced from that of the mantle by about 3.55 arcmin nearly in the plane containing the Cassini state. The core spin lags the precessing plane containing the Cassini state by an increasing angle as the core viscosity is increased. With the maximum viscosity considered of m $ 15:0 cm2=s if the coupling is by the circulation through an Ekman boundary layer or m $ 8:75 Â 105 cm2=s for purely viscous coupling, the core spin lags the precessing Cassini plane by 23 arcsec, whereas the mantle spin lags by only 0.055 arcsec. Larger, non-hydrostatic values of the CMB ellipticity also result in the mantle spin at the Cassini state, but the core spin is moved closer to the mantle spin. Current measurement uncertainties preclude using the mantle offset to constrain the internal core viscosity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Peale","given":"Stanton J."},{"family":"Margot","given":"Jean-Luc"},{"family":"Hauck","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Sean C."}],"citation-key":"PealeEtAl2014","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2013.12.007","ISSN":"00191035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3]]},"language":"en","page":"206-220","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effect of core–mantle and tidal torques on Mercury’s spin axis orientation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019103513005162","volume":"231"},

In particular, we show that the amplitudes of the semi-annual prograde (p2) and the ter-annual retrograde (r3) nutations will be determined with a precision of 6 and 4 milliarcseconds respectively by combining 700 days of RISE data with 700 days of LaRa data, about 35% more precise than what is expected from RISE alone.

  {"id":"PfefferEtAl2023","abstract":"Oscillations with a periodicity around 6 years have long been observed in the Earth's rotation, expressed as changes in the length of day, and robustly attributed to dynamical processes in the fluid outer core pursuant to the analysis of geomagnetic data. Recently, a 6-year cycle has also been discovered in the global mean sea level changes and in some of its main contributors (i.e., mass balances of the ice sheets and glaciers). Here, we report additional observations of the 6-year cycle in the climate system. Large oscillations at periods around 6 years are detected in terrestrial water storage changes estimated from satellite gravity measurements and global hydrological models, in agreement with satellite and in-situ precipitation observations. We also find a significant 6-year cycle in the global mean Earth's surface temperature observed since the beginning of the 1980s. Finally, in agreement with previous studies, we report a 6-year cycle in the atmospheric angular momentum in opposition of phase with the length of day. As changes in the length of day are in opposition with respect to changes in the solid Earth's rotation, this suggests that the atmosphere and the solid Earth rotate together at a 6-year period, possibly in response to deep Earth's processes. These new discoveries raise the question of the links between dynamical processes occurring in the core, solid Earth and superficial fluid envelopes at the 6-year period, as well as the nature of the mechanisms driving 6-year oscillations in integrative geodetic variables, such as the length of day or gravity field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pfeffer","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Cazenave","given":"Anny"},{"family":"Rosat","given":"Séverine"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Lorena"},{"family":"Mandea","given":"Mioara"},{"family":"Dehant","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Coupry","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"PfefferEtAl2023","container-title":"Global and Planetary Change","container-title-short":"Global and Planetary Change","DOI":"10.1016/j.gloplacha.2023.104245","ISSN":"0921-8181","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"page":"104245","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A 6-year cycle in the Earth system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818123002187","volume":"229"},
  {"id":"PhilidetGizon2023","abstract":"Inertial modes have been observed on the Sun at low longitudinal wavenumbers. These modes probe the dynamics and structure of the solar convection zone down to the tachocline. While linear analysis allows the complex eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of these modes to be computed, it gives no information about their excitation nor about their amplitudes. We tested the hypothesis that solar inertial modes are stochastically excited by the turbulent motions entailed by convection. We have developed a theoretical formalism where the turbulent velocity fluctuations provide the mechanical work necessary to excite the modes. The modes are described by means of a 2D linear wave equation, relevant for the quasi-toroidal modes observed on the Sun, with a source term, under the beta plane approximation. Latitudinal differential rotation is included in the form of a parabolic profile that approximates the solar differential rotation at low and mid latitudes. We obtain synthetic power spectra for the wave's latitudinal velocity, longitudinal velocity, and radial vorticity, with azimuthal orders between 1 and 20. The synthetic power spectra contain the classical equatorial Rossby modes, as well as a rich spectrum of additional modes. The mode amplitudes are found to be of the same order of magnitude as observed on the Sun (~ 1 m/s). There is a qualitative transition between low and high azimuthal orders: the power spectra for m < 5 show modes that are clearly resolved in frequency space, while the power spectra for m > 5 display regions of excess power that consist of many overlapping modes. The general agreement between the predicted and observed inertial mode amplitudes supports the assumption of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection. Our work shows that the power spectra are not easily separable into individual modes, thus complicated the interpretation of the observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Philidet","given":"J."},{"family":"Gizon","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"PhilidetGizon2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.05926","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,12]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.05926","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Interaction of solar inertial modes with turbulent convection.

  {"id":"Phillips1963","abstract":"If inertial waves in a uniformly rotating fluid reflect from a rigid plane surface, it is shown that the magnitudes of the incident and reflected wavenumbers are generally unequal. The reflection process thus provides an interchange of energy among different scalar wavenumbers k. In an inviscid fluid, the ratio α(k)/k is conserved on reflection, where α is the particle orbit speed associated with the wavenumber k. In a viscous fluid the reflection coefficient is generally 1 -0(R1/2 ), where R is the wave Reynolds number 2Ω/vk2, though there is an exceptional case in which the incident energy flux is totally absorbed. When the fluid is contained in a large rotating box of general shape, the energy interchanges from repeated reflections can result in a statistical radiative equilibrium over the high wavenumbers. A dynamical equation is derived that specifies E θ(k), the energy distribution among wavenumbers inclined at an angle θ to the rotation vector. An approximate solution shows that E θ(k) is constant when k ≪ kv = (Ω/vL) 1/3, where L is the size of the domain. When k ≫ kv, the spectrum decreases exponentially.","author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"O.

However, in light of non conclusive detection signals and strong constraints from collider, direct and indirect detection experiments, this thesis presents constraints on several realizations of the WIMP paradigm in the context of simplified dark matter models. More elaborated models considering extended gauge structures are discussed further on, such as constructions involving generalized Chern-Simons couplings and a specific WIMP scenario motivated by recently observed flavour anomalies related to the $R_{K^{(*)}}$ observable. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the discussion of an alternative dark matter thermal production mechanism where an explicit realization of the Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs) paradigm is discussed in the context of a non-Abelian hidden gauge structure. In a last part, the possibility of producing non-thermally a dark matter component via the \"freeze-in\" mechanism was investigated and the strong impact of the post-inflationary reaheating stage of the universe on such constructions illustrated by the specific case where dark matter density production is mediated by a heavy spin-2 field in addition to the standard graviton.","author":[{"family":"Pierre","given":"Mathias"}],"citation-key":"Pierre2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"273","title":"Dark Matter phenomenology : from simplified WIMP models to refined alternative solutions","type":"thesis","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05822"},

We aim to provide additional insights into this phenomenon. We calculate how the frequencies of the relevant inertial modes, and their overlap integrals with the tidal forces, vary as the star's rotation rate increases, spanning almost the full range between zero rotation and the mass-shedding limit. We prove that a single inertial mode couples to a Newtonian tidal field; overlap integrals with all other modes vanish.

Static tides are purely poloidal. Generalized apsidal-motion constants connected with dynamic tides are defined. A mathematical basis for integrating the system of governing equations is presented, taking into account the singular positions of the system. The system of equations is numerically integrated for a model main sequence star of five solar masses. The variation of the radial component of the tidal field at the star's surface is analyzed as a function of the external frequency imposed.

We consider if these layers could contribute to the high rates of tidal dissipation observed for Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. We use an idealised global spherical Boussinesq model to study the influence of stable stratification and semi-convective layers on tidal dissipation rates. We carry out analytical and numerical calculations considering realistic tidal forcing and measure how the viscous and thermal dissipation rates depend on the parameters relating to the internal stratification profile. We find that the strongly frequency-dependent tidal dissipation rate is highly dependent on the parameters relating to the stable stratification, with strong resonant peaks that align with the internal modes of the system. The locations and sizes of these resonances depend on the form and parameters of the stratification, which we explore both analytically and numerically. Our results suggest that stable stratification can significantly enhance the tidal dissipation in particular frequency ranges. Analytical calculations in the low frequency regime give us scaling laws for the key parameters, including the tidal quality factor $Q'$ due to internal gravity waves. Stably stratified layers can significantly contribute to tidal dissipation in solar and extrasolar giant planets, and we estimate substantial tidal evolution for hot Neptunes. Further investigation is needed to robustly quantify the significance of the contribution in realistic interior models, and to consider the contribution of inertial waves.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Pontin","given":"Christina M."},{"family":"Barker","given":"Adrian J."},{"family":"Hollerbach","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"PontinEtAl2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2304.11898","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"number":"arXiv:2304.11898","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Tidal dissipation in stratified and semi-convective regions of giant planets","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11898"},

In images acquired by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), this region is circumscribed by a chain of folded ridges and troughs at approximately 55 degrees S latitude. The terrain southward of this boundary is distinguished by its albedo and color contrasts, elevated temperatures, extreme geologic youth, and narrow tectonic rifts that exhibit coarse-grained ice and coincide with the hottest temperatures measured in the region. Jets of fine icy particles that supply Saturn's E ring emanate from this province, carried aloft by water vapor probably venting from subsurface reservoirs of liquid water.

  {"id":"PrixEtAl2004","abstract":"We present results concerning adiabatic inertial-mode oscillations of non-stratified superfluid neutron stars in Newtonian gravity, using the anelastic and slow-rotation approximations. We consider a simple two-fluid model of a superfluid neutron star, \none fluid consists of the superfluid neutrons and the second fluid contains all the comoving constituents (protons, electrons). The two fluids are assumed to be ‘free’ in the sense that vortex-mediated forces such as mutual friction or pinning are absent, but they can be coupled by the equation of state, in particular by entrainment. The stationary background consists of the two fluids rotating uniformly around the same axis with potentially different rotation rates. We study the special cases of corotating backgrounds, vanishing entrainment, and the purely toroidal r modes analytically. We calculate numerically the eigenfunctions and frequencies of inertial modes in the general case of non-corotating backgrounds, and study their dependence on the relative rotation rate and entrainment. In these non-stratified models, we find avoided crossings only between associated mode pairs, e.g. an ‘ordinary’ mode and its ‘superfluid’ counterpart, while other mode frequencies generally cross as the background parameters are varied. We confirm (for the first time in a mode calculation) the onset of a ‘two-stream instability’ at a critical relative background rotation rate, and we study some of the properties of this instability for the inertial modes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Prix","given":"R."},{"family":"Comer","given":"G.

  {"id":"PuicaEtAl2023","abstract":"The Earth’s rotation exhibits periodic variations as a result of gravitational torques exerted by the Sun and the Moon and of angular momentum exchange of the solid Earth with the Earth’s atmosphere and hydrosphere. Here, we aim at determining the complementary effect of the deep interior on variations in the length-of-day (LOD) and focus on the influence of topography at the core–mantle boundary (CMB). For this purpose, we have developed an analytical approach for solving the Navier–Stokes equation for global rotational motions and inertial waves, based on and extending the approach of Wu &amp; Wahr (1997). An advantage of the analytical approach is that it allows to identify the frequencies and topographic spherical harmonics degrees and orders where resonance can happen, as well as to quantify the total amplifications in the tidal effects on LOD variations. Although the resonances are found to be sometimes quite near tidal frequencies, we show that they are not sufficiently close to induce significant perturbations in LOD variations, except for two of the tides, the fortnightly and monthly tides Mf and Mm. Our results go beyond the findings of Wu &amp; Wahr (1997), extending them to a much wider range of degrees and orders of topographic coefficients. We show that there is an amplification in Mf and Mm induced by the degree 18-order 10 and by the degree 7-order 1 of the topography, respectively. Our approach is generic in the sense that it can be applied to other orientation changes of the Earth as well as to other planets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Puica","given":"M"},{"family":"Dehant","given":"V"},{"family":"Folgueira","given":"M"},{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"T"},{"family":"Rekier","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"PuicaEtAl2023","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggad077","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"585-596","source":"Silverchair","title":"Analytical computation of total topographic torque at the core–mantle boundary and its impact on tidally driven length-of-day variations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad077","volume":"234"},

However, a complete analytical description and understanding of internal waves in arbitrarily shaped enclosed domains, such as the ocean or a planet liquid core, is still missing. In this work, the inviscid, linear inertial wave field is investigated by means of three-dimensional ray tracing in spherical shell domains, having in mind possible oceanographic applications. Rays are here classically interpreted as representative of energy paths, but in contrast to previous studies, they are now launched with a non-zero initial zonal component allowing for a more realistic, localized forcing and the development of azimuthal inhomogeneities. We find that meridional planes generally act in the shell geometry as attractors for ray trajectories. In addition, the existence of trajectories that are not subject to meridional trapping is here observed for the first time. Their dynamics was not captured by the previous purely meridional studies and unveils a new class of possible solutions for inertial motion in the spherical shell. Both observed behaviours shed some new light on possible mechanisms of energy localization, a key process that still deserves further investigation in our ocean, as well as in other stratified, rotating media. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.","author":[{"family":"Rabitti","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Maas","given":"Leo R.M."}],"citation-key":"RabittiMaas2013","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2013.310","ISSN":"00221120","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"page":"445-470","title":"Meridional trapping and zonal propagation of inertial waves in a rotating fluid shell","type":"article-journal","volume":"729"},

In particular, the classical, two-dimensional association between regular modes and periodic trajectories is addressed here for the first time in a fully three-dimensional setting. Three-dimensional, repelling periodic trajectories are found and classified on the basis of the associated frequency and spatial structure, although associated frequencies are hardly reconcilable to Bryan's (Proc. R. Soc. Lond., vol. 45, 1889, pp. 42-45) classical solutions for inertial waves in the sphere. The normalized squared frequency ω2 = 1/2 appears to divide the frequency range into two different trajectory regimes, where critical latitudes play a different role. Chaotic orbits are not found, as expected, while invariant, non-domain-filling orbits (whispering gallery modes) constitute the majority of the trajectories in the sphere. From ray tracing alone, the wavefield is still far from being completely reconstructed, and a study performed in such a simplified setting is clearly far from any realistic application, however, it appears that three-dimensional ray dynamics constitutes a valid approach to infer information on the spectrum and regularity properties of a system, and is then able to bring new insight in a variety of fundamental problems of geophysical and astrophysical relevance, once its power and limitations have been recognized.","author":[{"family":"Rabitti","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Maas","given":"Leo R.M."}],"citation-key":"RabittiMaas2014","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2014.551","ISSN":"14697645","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"621-654","title":"Inertial wave rays in rotating spherical fluid domains","type":"article-journal","volume":"758"},

Future geodetic observations with, for example, space missions like the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) of NASA and ESA may refine our knowledge about the shell and ocean. <i>Aims.<i/> Measurement of librational motion is a useful tool for detecting an ocean and characterizing the interior parameters of the moons. The objective of this paper is to investigate the librational response of Galilean satellites, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto assumed to have a subsurface ocean by taking the perturbations of the Keplerian orbit into account. Perturbations from a purely Keplerian orbit are caused by gravitational attraction of the other Galilean satellites, the Sun, and the oblateness of Jupiter.<i>Methods.<i/> We use the librational equations developed for a satellite with a subsurface ocean in synchronous spin-orbit resonance. The orbital perturbations were obtained from recent ephemerides of the Galilean satellites.<i>Results.<i/> We identify the wide frequency spectrum in the librational response for each Galilean moon. The librations can be separated into two groups, one with short periods close to the orbital period, and a second group of long-period librations related to the gravitational interactions with the other moons and the Sun. Long-period librations can have amplitudes as large as or even larger than the amplitude of the main libration at orbital period for the Keplerian problem, implying the need to introduce them in analyses of observations linked to the rotation. The amplitude of the short-period librations contains information on the interior of the moons, but the amplitude associated with long periods is almost independent of the interior at first order in the low frequency. For Europa, we identified a short-period libration with period close to twice the orbital period, which could have been resonantly amplified in the history of Europa. For Ganymede, we also found a possible resonance between a proper period and a forced period when the icy shell thickness is around 50 km. The librations of Callisto are dominated by solar perturbations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rambaux","given":"N."},{"family":"Hoolst","given":"T.

Convective motions play an important role in generating neutron stars magnetic fields, which could explain magnetar formation in the presence of fast rotation. We compute the gravitational wave emission from proto-neutron star convection and its associated dynamo, by post-processing three-dimensional MHD simulations of a model restricted to the convective zone in the anelastic approximation. We consider two different proto-neutron star structures representative of early times (with a convective layer) and late times (when the star is almost entirely convective). In the slow rotation regime, the gravitational wave emission follows a broad spectrum peaking at about three times the turnover frequency. In this regime, the inclusion of magnetic fields slightly decreases the amplitude without changing the spectrum significantly compared to a non-magnetized simulation. Fast rotation changes both the amplitude and spectrum dramatically. The amplitude is increased by a factor of up to a few thousands. The spectrum is characterized by several peaks associated with inertial modes, whose frequency scales with the rotation frequency. Using simple physical arguments, we derive scalings that reproduce quantitatively several aspects of these numerical results. We also observe an excess of low-frequency gravitational waves, which appears at the transition to a strong field dynamo characterized by a strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field. This signature of dynamo action could be used to constrain the dynamo efficiency in a proto-neutron star with future gravitational wave detections.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Raynaud","given":"Raphaël"},{"family":"Cerdá-Durán","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Guilet","given":"Jérôme"}],"citation-key":"RaynaudEtAl2022","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","container-title-short":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/stab3109","ISSN":"0035-8711","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,21]]},"page":"3410-3426","source":"Silverchair","title":"Gravitational wave signature of proto-neutron star convection: I.

  {"id":"RekierEtAl2021","abstract":"Observation of the variations in the Earth’s rotation at time scales ranging from subdiurnal to multidecadal allows us to learn about its deep interior structure. We review all three types of motion of the Earth’s rotation axis: polar motion (PM), length of day variations (Δ  LOD ) and nutations, with particular attention to how the combination of geodetic, magnetic and gravity observations provides insight into the dynamics of the liquid core, including its interactions with the mantle. Models of the Earth’s PM are able to explain most of the observed signal with the exception of the so-called Markowitz wobble. In addition, whereas the quasi-six year oscillations (SYO) observed in both ΔLOD and PM can be explained as the result of Atmosphere, Oceans and Hydrosphere Forcing (AOH) for PM, this is not true for ΔLOD where the subtraction of the AOH only makes the signal more visible. This points to a missing—possibly common—interpretation related to deep interior dynamics, the latter being also the most likely explanation of other oscillations in ΔLOD on interannual timescales. Deep Earth’s structure and dynamics also have an impact on the nutations reflected in the values of the Basic Earth Parameters (BEP). We give a brief review of recent works aiming to independently evaluate the BEP and their implications for the study of deep interior dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rekier","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Chao","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianli"},{"family":"Dehant","given":"Véronique"},{"family":"Rosat","given":"Séverine"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ping"}],"citation-key":"RekierEtAl2021","container-title":"Surveys in Geophysics","container-title-short":"Surv Geophys","DOI":"10.1007/s10712-021-09669-x","ISSN":"1573-0956","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"language":"en","license":"All rights reserved","page":"149-175","source":"Springer Link","title":"Earth’s Rotation: Observations and Relation to Deep Interior","title-short":"Earth’s Rotation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10712-021-09669-x","volume":"43"},

The definition of the electric field depends on the frame of reference leading to an ambiguity in the mathematical expression of the continuity condition when the two sides of the interface do not share the same rest frame. We briefly review the arguments supporting each choice of interface condition and illustrate how the most theoretically consistant choice leads to a paradox in induction experiments. We then present a model of sliding contact between two solids and between a fluid and a solid, and show how this paradox can be lifted by taking into account the shear induced by the differential motion in a thin intermediate viscous layer at the interface, thereby also lifting the ambiguity in the electric interface condition. We present some guidelines regarding the appropriate interface condition to employ in numerical simulations where sliding contact is used as an approximation to the viscous interface between a conducting solid and a fluid of very low viscosity such as in planetary interior simulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rekier","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Triana","given":"Santiago A."},{"family":"Trinh","given":"Antony"},{"family":"Buffett","given":"Bruce A."}],"citation-key":"RekierEtAl2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2303.00718","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,1]]},"license":"All rights reserved","number":"arXiv:2303.00718","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Electric interface condition for sliding and viscous contacts","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00718"},

We show this instability to be caused by triadic interaction involving two inertial waves and a geostrophic mode such that the sum of their eigen frequencies is non-zero. We derive theoretical scalings for the growth rate of this near-resonant instability which is proportional to $Ro^2$ at low $Ro$ and transitions to a $Ro$ law at moderate $Ro$.

  {"id":"RicardEtAl2022","abstract":"The numerical simulations of convection inside the mantle of the Earth or of terrestrial planets have been based on approximate equations of ﬂuid dynamics. A common approximation is the neglect of the inertia term which is certainly reasonable as the Reynolds number of silicate mantles, or their inverse Prandtl number, are inﬁnitesimally small. However various other simpliﬁcations are made which we discuss in this paper. The crudest approximation that can be done is the Boussinesq approximation (BA) where the various parameters are constant and the variations of density are only included in the buoyancy term and assumed to be proportional to temperature with a constant thermal expansivity. The variations of density with pressure and the related physical consequences (mostly the presence of an adiabatic temperature gradient and of dissipation) are usually accounted for by using an anelastic approximation (AA) initially developed for astrophysical and atmospheric situations. The BA and AA cases provide simpliﬁed but self-consistent systems of differential equations. Intermediate approximations are also common in the geophysical literature although they are invariably associated with theoretical inconsistencies (non-conservation of total energy, non-conservation of statistically steady state heat ﬂow with depth, momentum and entropy equations implying inconsistent dissipations). We show that, in the inﬁnite Prandtl number case, solving the fully compressible (FC) equations of convection with a realistic equation of state (EoS) is however not much more difﬁcult or numerically challenging than solving the approximate cases. We compare various statistical properties of the Boussinesq, AA and FC simulations in 2-D simulations. We point to an inconsistency of the AA approximation when the two heat capacities are assumed constant. We suggest that at high Rayleigh number, the proﬁle of dissipation in a convective mantle can be directly related to the surface heat ﬂux. Our results are mostly discussed in the framework of mantle convection but the EoS we used is ﬂexible enough to be applied for convection in icy planets or in the inner core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ricard","given":"Yanick"},{"family":"Alboussière","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Labrosse","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Curbelo","given":"Jezabel"},{"family":"Dubuffet","given":"Fabien"}],"citation-key":"RicardEtAl2022","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggac102","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,12]]},"language":"en","page":"932-956","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fully compressible convection for planetary mantles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/230/2/932/6551894","volume":"230"},

These modes appear to be strongly featured by a web of rays which reflect on the boundaries. Kinetic energy and dissipation are indeed concentrated on thin conical sheets, the meridional cross- section of which forms the web of rays. The thickness of the rays is in general independent of the Ekman number E but a few cases show a scaling with E1/4 and statistical properties of eigenvalues indicate that high-wavenumber modes have rays of width O(E1/3). Such scalings are typical of Stewartson shear layers. It is also shown that the web of rays depends on the Ekman number and shows bifurcations as this number is decreased.

  {"id":"Rieutord2000","abstract":"We investigate the asymptotic properties of inertial modes confined in a spherical shell when viscosity tends to zero. We first consider the mapping made by the characteristics of the hyperbolic equation (Poincaré's equation) satisfied by inviscid solutions. Characteristics are straight lines in a meridional section of the shell, and the mapping shows that, generically, these lines converge towards a periodic orbit which acts like an attractor (the associated Lyapunov exponent is always negative or zero). We show that these attractors exist in bands of frequencies the size of which decreases with the number of reflection points of the attractor. At the bounding frequencies the associated Lyapunov exponent is generically either zero or minus infinity. We further show that for a given frequency the number of coexisting attractors is finite. We then examine the relation between this characteristic path and eigensolutions of the inviscid problem and show that in a purely two-dimensional problem, convergence towards an attractor means that the associated velocity field is not square-integrable. We give arguments which generalize this result to three dimensions. Then, using a sphere immersed in a fluid filling the whole space, we study the critical latitude singularity and show that the velocity field diverges as 1/ √d, d being the distance to the characteristic grazing the inner sphere. We then consider the viscous problem and show how viscosity transforms singularities into internal shear layers which in general reveal an attractor expected at the eigenfrequency of the mode. Investigating the structure of these shear layers, we find that they are nested layers, the thinnest and most internal layer scaling with E 1/3, E being the Ekman number; for this latter layer, we give its analytical form and show its similarity to vertical 1/3-shear layers of steady flows. Using an inertial wave packet travelling around an attractor, we give a lower bound on the thickness of shear layers and show how eigenfrequencies can be computed in principle. Finally, we show that as viscosity decreases, eigenfrequencies tend towards a set of values which is not dense in [0,2Ω], contrary to the case of the full sphere (Ω is the angular velocity of the system). Hence, our geometrical approach opens the possibility of describing the eigenmodes and eigenvalues for astrophysical/geophysical Ekman numbers (10 -10-10 -20), which are out of reach numerically, and this for a wide class of containers.","author":[{"family":"Rieutord","given":"M."},{"family":"Georgeot","given":"B."},{"family":"Valdettaro","given":"L."}],"citation-key":"Rieutord2000","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/S0022112001003718","ISSN":"00221120","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"103-144","title":"Inertial waves in a rotating spherical shell: Attractors and asymptotic spectrum","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112001003718","volume":"435"},

Here, we try to clarify this behaviour and show that it is a result of the different physical approach taken by each approximation. On the one hand, the subseismic approximation considers the low-frequency part of the spectrum of (say) gravity modes and turns out to be valid only in the central region of a star; on the other hand, the anelastic approximation considers the Brunt–Va¨isa¨la¨ frequency to be asymptotically small and makes no assumption concerning the order of the modes.

  {"id":"RivoldiniEtAl2011","abstract":"Knowledge of the interior structure of Mars is of fundamental importance to the understanding of its past and present state as well as its future evolution. The most prominent interior structure properties are the state of the core, solid or liquid, its radius, and its composition in terms of light elements, the thickness of the mantle, its composition, the presence of a lower mantle, and the density of the crust. In the absence of seismic sounding only geodesy data allow reliably constraining the deep interior of Mars. Those data are the mass, moment of inertia, and tides. They are related to Mars’ composition, to its internal mass distribution, and to its deformational response to principally the tidal forcing of the Sun. Here we use the most recent estimates of the moment of inertia and tidal Love number k2 in order to infer knowledge about the interior structure of the Mars. We have built precise models of the interior structure of Mars that are parameterized by the crust density and thickness, the volume fractions of upper mantle mineral phases, the bulk mantle iron concentration, and the size and the sulfur concentration of the core. From the bulk mantle iron concentration and from the volume fractions of the upper mantle mineral phases, the depth dependent mineralogy is deduced by using experimentally determined phase diagrams. The thermoelastic properties at each depth inside the mantle are calculated by using equations of state. Since it is difficult to determine the temperature inside the mantle of Mars we here use two end-member temperature profiles that have been deduced from studies dedicated to the thermal evolution of Mars. We calculate the pressure and temperature dependent thermoelastic properties of the core constituents by using equations state and recent data about reference thermoelastic properties of liquid iron, liquid iron–sulfur, and solid iron. To determine the size of a possible inner core we use recent data on the melting temperature of iron–sulfur. Within our model assumptions the geodesy data imply that Mars has no solid inner core and that the liquid core contains a large fraction of sulfur. The absence of a solid inner is in agreement with the absence of a global magnetic field. We estimate the radius of the core to be 1794±65km and its core sulfur concentration to be 16±2wt%. We also show that it is possible for Mars to have a thin layer of perovskite at the bottom of the mantle if it has a hot mantle temperature. Moreover a chondritic Fe/Si ratio is shown to be consistent with the geodesy data, although significantly different value are also possible. Our results demonstrate that geodesy data alone, even if a mantle temperature is assumed, can almost not constrain the mineralogy of the mantle and the crust. In order to obtain stronger constraints on the mantle mineralogy bulk properties, like a fixed Fe/Si ratio, have to be assumed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rivoldini","given":"A."},{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"T."},{"family":"Verhoeven","given":"O."},{"family":"Mocquet","given":"A."},{"family":"Dehant","given":"V."}],"citation-key":"RivoldiniEtAl2011","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2011.03.024","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"451-472","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Geodesy constraints on the interior structure and composition of Mars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103511001151","volume":"213"},

  {"id":"Roberts2015","abstract":"Enceladus is well known for its young south polar terrain, observed by Cassini to emit several GW of heat as well as plumes of vapor and ice. The source of this energy is believed to be tidal dissipation. However, the observed south polar heat flux cannot be sustained over the age of the Solar System. Furthermore, thermal evolution models suggest that any global subsurface ocean should freeze on a timescale of tens to hundreds of My, sharply reducing future tidal heating, unless large amounts of antifreeze are present in the ocean. Here I propose an alternative internal structure for Enceladus, in which the silicate core is fragmented, and that the tidal deformation of the core may be partially controlled by interstitial ice. I find that fragmentation of the core increases tidal dissipation by a factor of 20, consistent with the long-term dynamically sustainable level, even when the interior is completely frozen, but only if the interior starts out warm and tidal heating is strong from the beginning. If this is not the case, radioactive heating will be insufficient to prevent the interior from cooling. Although an ocean need not be present in order for the interior to experience significant tidal heating, all models that dissipate enough heat to prevent runaway cooling are also warm enough to have an ocean. Tidal dissipation in the weak core provides an additional source of heat that may prevent a global subsurface ocean from freezing.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"James H."}],"citation-key":"Roberts2015","container-title":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2015.05.033","ISSN":"10902643","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"54-66","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"The fluffy core of Enceladus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2015.05.033","volume":"258"},

  {"id":"RobertsEtAl2010","abstract":"In a celebrated recent experiment, Monchaux, et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2007, 98, 044502) created a self-excited dynamo in a cylindrical container of liquid sodium by a turbulent flow created by counter-rotating impellers at the plane ends of the container. A strange feature of the experiment was its failure to generate magnetic field when the impellers were made of stainless steel; success required the impellers to be made of soft iron. The results reported here were generated by numerical simulations of an idealization of the experiment. The container is a sphere and the impellers are replaced by a differential zonal motion of its surface, the northern and southern hemispheres turning about the symmetry axis in opposite senses, the whole system being contained in a thin shell with which it is in perfect electrical contact. This shell has generally a finite electrical conductance and a magnetic permeability that can greatly exceed that of the fluid. The electrodynamic effect of the shell is represented by a thin-wall boundary condition, similar but not identical to that used in MHD duct flow theory. Eleven cases were considered, in four of which the surface shell is an electrical insulator; in the others it is made of a conducting material which, like soft iron, might have a large permeability. In eight cases, a seed field decays away but in three it is amplified and becomes a turbulent self-excited dynamo. Through four cases of the same surface motion and shell permeability, it is inferred that an increase in the shell conductance assists the regeneration of magnetic field. It is also shown that enhancing the shell permeability assists the field creation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Paul H."},{"family":"Glatzmaier","given":"Gary A."},{"family":"Clune","given":"Thomas L."}],"citation-key":"RobertsEtAl2010","container-title":"Geophysical and Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics","DOI":"10.1080/03091920903439753","ISSN":"03091929","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"207-220","title":"Numerical simulation of a spherical dynamo excited by a flow of von Kármán type","type":"article-journal","volume":"104"},
  {"id":"RobertsEtAl2018","abstract":"© 2018 American Association of Physics Teachers. Electrons in an atom are confined to distinct, quantized energy levels. When atoms form solids, the interaction of the electrons causes their energy levels to split into multiple closely spaced levels, or bands, separated by forbidden regions called band gaps. Each band contains a number of energy levels equal to the number of atoms in the solid. This model of the origin of band structure can be reproduced by using a classical array of harmonic oscillators (masses connected by springs). In this system, each oscillator plays the role of an atom and its resonant frequencies play the roles of electronic energy levels. When coupled, a system of oscillators yields a spectrum of resonant frequencies and when the number of oscillators becomes sufficiently large, the system exhibits the formation of \"resonant frequency bands,\" similar in structure to the energy bands of an atomic solid. We experimentally demonstrate band formation using coupled harmonic oscillators and highlight the effects of both number of oscillators and coupling strength on the band structure. Additionally, we show that experimental results of this band formation follow a theoretical analysis of the system.","author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Parker"},{"family":"Skinner","given":"Alexandria"},{"family":"Cobb","given":"Tadan"},{"family":"Carr","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Hilbert","given":"Shawn A."}],"citation-key":"RobertsEtAl2018","container-title":"American Journal of Physics","DOI":"10.1119/1.5045332","ISSN":"0002-9505","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"609-615","title":"A classical analogy for quantum band formation","type":"article-journal","volume":"86"},

His simple idea, that the geomagnetic field is the result of dynamo action in the Earth’s electrically conducting, fluid core, encountered many difficulties, but these have by now been largely overcome, while alternative proposals have been found to be untenable. The development of the theory and its current status are reviewed below. The basic electrodynamics are summarized, but the main focus is on dynamical questions. A special study is made of the energy and entropy requirements of the dynamo and in particular of how efficient it is, considered as a heat engine. Particular attention is paid to modeling core magnetohydrodynamics in a way that is tractable but nevertheless incorporates the dynamical effects of core turbulence in an approximate way. This theory has been tested by numerical integrations, some results from which are presented. The success of these simulations seems to be considerable, when measured against the known geomagnetic facts summarized here.

  {"id":"Rochester2014","abstract":"This paper presents a novel mathematical reformulation of the theory of the free wobble/nutation of an axisymmetric reference earth model in hydrostatic equilibrium, using the linear momentum description. The new features of this work consist in the use of (i) Clairaut coordinates (rather than spherical polars), (ii) standard spherical harmonics (rather than generalized spherical surface harmonics), (iii) linear operators (rather than J-square symbols) to represent the effects of rotational and ellipticity coupling between dependent variables of different harmonic degree and (iv) a set of dependent variables all of which are continuous across material boundaries. The resulting infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations is given explicitly, for an elastic solid mantle and inner core, an inviscid outer core and no magnetic field. The formulation is done to second order in the Earth's ellipticity. To this order it is shown that for wobble modes (in which the lowest harmonic in the displacement field is degree 1 toroidal, with azimuthal order m=±1), it is sufficient to truncate the chain of coupled displacement fields at the toroidal harmonic of degree 5 in the solid parts of the earth model. In the liquid core, however, the harmonic expansion of displacement can in principle continue to indefinitely high degree at this order of accuracy. The full equations are shown to yield correct results in three simple cases amenable to analytic solution: a general earth model in rigid rotation, the tiltover mode in a homogeneous solid earth model and the tiltover and Chandler periods for an incompressible homogeneous solid earth model.

Estimates of Q1 for kinematic dynamo models range from 109 to over 1012 Watts, depending on the particular regenerative scheme characterizing the dynamo. Precessional power input to the magnetic field can be estimated in terms of the electromagnetic part of the core-mantle coupling and the tiltover angle (inclination of the core angular momentum vector to that of the mantle). We correct Stacey's estimate of core-mantle coupling to take into account the diurnal frequency of precession-induced flow relative to the mantle, and show that the power available from precession to stir the core cannot exceed 108 W if the core flow remains stable.

In parallel, surﬁcial processes (oceanic, atmospheric and hydrological loading) are more and more precisely modelled. We propose a confrontation of the geodetic Global Positioning System (GPS) and gravity-ﬁeld satellite laser ranging (SLR) observations at decadal and interannual timescales, in terms of resolution, correlation and comparison with surﬁcial loading models. We focus on the largest global scale signals of degree 2. At interannual periods, surface deformations retrieved from GPS time-series do not exceed 0.8 mm. Our analysis does not reveal the presence of a dominant signal at a speciﬁc period, except perhaps for a signal of approximately 3 yr likely connected to the loading response to El Nin˜o/Southern Oscillations. Contrary to the results of previous studies, we do not ﬁnd in GPS time-series a clear 6-yr oscillation associated with a degree-2 order-2 pattern. Interannual variations in the degree-2 Stokes coefﬁcients of the gravity ﬁeld do not exceed 2 × 10−11. We do not detect a dominant gravity signal at one speciﬁc period but instead a broad spectrum of frequencies. The comparison between the degree-2 deformations built from GPS time-series with a prediction from SLR-derived gravity variations reveals some correlations, though their differences remain important. This highlights the present day limitations of these techniques in their ability to characterize global scale interannual variations. Hydrological loading models show some correlations with both GPS and SLR signals, but we cannot ﬁrmly establish that continental hydrology is dominantly responsible for the observed variations. Given the current limits in the resolution of both gravity and surface deformation and in the modelling of surface processes, we conclude that it will be a challenge to retrieve a geodetic signal of subdecadal period originating in the Earth’s core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosat","given":"S"},{"family":"Gillet","given":"N"},{"family":"Boy","given":"J-P"},{"family":"Couhert","given":"A"},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"RosatEtAl2020","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggaa590","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,11]]},"language":"en","page":"ggaa590","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interannual variations of degree 2 from geodetic observations and surface processes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gji/ggaa590/6031322"},

Tidal dissipation plays an important role in preventing these oceans from freezing. In the past, most studies considered only tidal dissipation in the solid layers of these bodies (rock and ice). Recently, new studies considering tidal dissipation in the oceans of these moons have appeared. All of them make use of the shallow water approximation. However, the use of this approximation might not be adequate. Here we consider the linear non-hydrostatic three dimensional response of these oceans to tidal forcing with the full Coriolis force. To do so we consider an ocean of homogeneous density contained within a perfectly spherical shell and neglect the effect of the ice shell. We force the ocean with a time changing tidal potential and observe patterns of periodic inertial waves that take energy from the global tidal forcing and focus it along thin shear layers that propagate in the fluid. We focus on Europa and Enceladus, showing that inertial waves result in fluid flows of significant amplitude (a few cm/s). Nevertheless, we find that under the previously mentioned assumptions tidal dissipation due to inertial waves is several orders of magnitude smaller than Europa's radiogenic heating and Enceladus’ observed heat flux.

  {"id":"Rovira-NavarroEtAl2020","abstract":"Tidal heating can play an important role in the formation and evolution of subsurface oceans of outer-planet moons. Up until now tidal heating has only been studied in subsurface oceans of spatially uniform thickness. We develop a numerical model to consider oceans of spatially variable thickness. We use the Laplace Tidal Equations for the ocean and model the ice shell using membrane theory. The problem is solved using the commercial Finite Element software Comsol Multiphysics®. We use this new model to study the tidal response of Enceladus' ocean with a twofold objective: to understand how ocean thickness variations modify the tidal response of a subsurface ocean and to assess if tidal dissipation in an Enceladan ocean with varying ocean thickness can explain the high heat flux emanating from Enceladus' South Polar Terrain and the perdurance of a subsurface ocean. We consider the effect of meridional ocean thickness changes of spherical harmonic degree two and three as suggested by topography and gravimetry data. We observe that an ocean with degree two topography responds with the same eigenmodes as an ocean of constant thickness but resonances occur for thicker oceans. However, resonant ocean thicknesses are still thin compared to current estimates for Enceladus ocean thickness. Rossby-Haurwitz waves, excited by the obliquity tide for thick oceans of constant thickness, are not excited at the tidal frequency when oceans of variable thickness are considered. This result implies that the role of the obliquity tide in ocean tidal-dissipation might have been overestimated for Enceladus and other icy worlds.

  {"id":"Rovira-NavarroEtAl2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            The inferred density of Enceladus' core, together with evidence of hydrothermal activity within the moon, suggests that the core is porous. Tidal dissipation in an unconsolidated core has been proposed as the main source of Enceladus' geological activity. However, the tidal response of its core has generally been modeled assuming it behaves viscoelastically rather than poroviscoelastically. In this work, we analyze the poroviscoelastic response to better constrain the distribution of tidal dissipation within Enceladus. A poroviscoelastic body has a different tidal response than a viscoelastic one; pressure within the pores alters the stress field and induces a Darcian porous flow. This flow represents an additional pathway for energy dissipation. Using Biot's theory of poroviscoelasticity, we develop a new framework to obtain the tidal response of a spherically symmetric, self‐gravitating moon with porous layers and apply it to Enceladus. We show that the boundary conditions at the interface of the core and overlying ocean play a key role in the tidal response. The ocean hinders the development of a large‐amplitude Darcian flow, making negligible the Darcian contribution to the dissipation budget. We therefore infer that Enceladus' core can be the source of its geological activity only if it has a low rigidity and a very low viscosity. A future mission to Enceladus could test this hypothesis by measuring the phase lags of tidally induced changes of gravitational potential and surface displacements.\n          , \n            Plain Language Summary\n            With a young surface, a subsurface water ocean and water plumes rising above its limb, tiny Enceladus is one of the most interesting bodies in the Solar System. The moon's geological activity is likely powered by Saturnian tides that periodically deform Enceladus, producing internal heat due to friction by a process known as tidal dissipation. Data from the Cassini mission shows that Enceladus' core is likely a porous medium throughout which water can circulate. We develop a model to study the tidally induced deformation of the core and how water flows within it. We find that for tidal heating to explain the moon's geological activity, Enceladus' core must be exceptionally weak. We show how a future mission could measure whether this is the case or not.\n          , \n            Key Points\n            \n              \n                \n                  We present a new method to compute the tidal response of moons with porous layers\n                \n                \n                  The boundary conditions at the porous layer boundaries control the moon's response\n                \n                \n                  Tidal dissipation in Enceladus' core can only account for the moon's observed thermal output if it is in a highly deformable state","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Rovira‐Navarro","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Katz","given":"Richard F."},{"family":"Liao","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Van Der Wal","given":"Wouter"},{"family":"Nimmo","given":"Francis"}],"citation-key":"Rovira-NavarroEtAl2022","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","container-title-short":"JGR Planets","DOI":"10.1029/2021JE007117","ISSN":"2169-9097, 2169-9100","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"en","page":"e2021JE007117","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"The Tides of Enceladus' Porous Core","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JE007117","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"Rovira-NavarroEtAl2023","abstract":"Several solar system moons harbor subsurface water oceans; extreme internal heating or solar irradiation can form magma oceans in terrestrial bodies. Tidal forces drive ocean currents, producing tidal heating that affects the thermal−orbital evolution of these worlds. If the outermost layers (ocean and overlying shell) are thin, tidal dynamics can be described using thin-shell theory. Previous work assumed that the ocean and shellʼs thickness and density are uniform. We present a formulation of thin-shell dynamics that relaxes these assumptions and apply it to several cases of interest. The tidal response of unstratiﬁed oceans of constant thickness is given by surface gravity and Rossby waves, which can resonate with the tidal force. The oceans of the outer solar system are too thick for gravity wave resonances, but high-amplitude Rossby waves can be excited in moons with high orbital obliquity. We ﬁnd that meridional ocean thickness variations hinder the excitation of Rossby waves, decreasing tidal dissipation and increasing the inclination damping timescale, which allows us to reconcile the present inclination of the Moon with the existence of a past long-lived magma ocean and to explain the inclination of Titan and Callisto without invoking a recent excitation. Stratiﬁed oceans can support internal gravity waves. We show that dissipation due to internal waves can exceed that resulting from surface gravity waves. For Enceladus, it can be close to the moon’s thermal output, even if the ocean is weakly stratiﬁed. Shear due to internal waves can result in Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities and induce ocean mixing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rovira-Navarro","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Matsuyama","given":"Isamu"},{"family":"Hay","given":"Hamish C.

The analysis is restricted to torsionally polarised footpoint motions in an axially symmetric system so that only torsional Alfven waves are excited. For this subclass of footpoint motions, the Alfven and cusp singularities are absent from the analysis which means that resonant coupling between global modes of the loop and localised oscillations is avoided. Instead, the focus is on the resonances due to the finite extent of the loop in the longitudinal direction: at the radii where Alfven waves travelling back and forth along the length of the loop are in phase with the footpoint motions, the oscillations grow unbounded in ideal MHD. Inclusion of electrical resistivity and viscosity as dissipation mechanisms prevents singular growth and we can look at the steady state in which the energy injected at the photospheric part of the loop is balanced by the energy dissipated at the dissipative layer around the resonance. In this sense, we show that the direct excitation of Alfven waves by torsionally polarised footpoint motions leads to a very efficient heating mechanism for coronal loops, even without resonant coupling to global modes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruderman","given":"M.

  {"id":"SaillenfestEtAl2021","abstract":"The obliquity of a planet is the tilt between its equator and its orbital plane. Giant planets are expected to form with near-zero obliquities1,2. After the formation of Saturn, some dynamical mechanism must therefore have tilted Saturn up to its current obliquity of 26.7°. This event is traditionally thought to have happened more than 4 Gyr ago during the late planetary migration3,4,5 because of the crossing of a resonance between the spin-axis precession of Saturn and the nodal orbital precession mode of Neptune6. Here, we show that the fast tidal migration of Titan for which the measurement is reported in ref. 7 is incompatible with this scenario, and that it offers a new explanation for Saturn's current obliquity. A substantial migration of Titan would prevent any early resonance, which would invalidate previous constraints on the late planetary migration that were set by the tilting of Saturn8,9,10. We propose instead that the resonance was encountered more recently, about 1 Gyr ago, and forced Saturn's obliquity to increase from a small value (possibly less than 3°) to its current state. This scenario suggests that Saturn's normalized polar moment of inertia lies between 0.224 and 0.237. Our findings bring out a new paradigm for the spin-axis evolution of Saturn, Jupiter11 and possibly giant exoplanets in multiple systems, whereby obliquities are not settled once for all but evolve continuously as a result of the migration of their satellites.","author":[{"family":"Saillenfest","given":"Melaine"},{"family":"Lari","given":"Giacomo"},{"family":"Boué","given":"Gwenaël"}],"citation-key":"SaillenfestEtAl2021","container-title":"Nature Astronomy","DOI":"10.1038/s41550-020-01284-x","ISSN":"23973366","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"The large obliquity of Saturn explained by the fast migration of Titan","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"SaurEtAl2015","abstract":"We present a new approach to search for a subsurface ocean within Ganymede through observations and modeling of the dynamics of its auroral ovals. The locations of the auroral ovals oscillate due to Jupiter's time-varying magnetospheric field seen in the rest frame of Ganymede. If an electrically conductive ocean is present, the external time-varying magnetic field is reduced due to induction within the ocean and the oscillation amplitude of the ovals decreases. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations show that the locations of the ovals oscillate on average by 2.0° ±1.3°. Our model calculations predict a significantly stronger oscillation by 5.8° ± 1.3° without ocean compared to 2.2°±1.3° if an ocean is present. Because the ocean and the no-ocean hypotheses cannot be separated by simple visual inspection of individual HST images, we apply a statistical analysis including a Monte Carlo test to also address the uncertainty caused by the patchiness of observed emissions. The observations require a minimum electrical conductivity of 0.09 S/m for an ocean assumed to be located between 150 km and 250 km depth or alternatively a maximum depth of the top of the ocean at 330 km. Our analysis implies that Ganymede's dynamo possesses an outstandingly low quadrupole-to-dipole moment ratio. The new technique applied here is suited to probe the interior of other planetary bodies by monitoring their auroral response to time-varying magnetic fields.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Saur","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Duling","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Roth","given":"Lorenz"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Xianzhe"},{"family":"Strobel","given":"Darrell F."},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Paul D."},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Ulrich R."},{"family":"Retherford","given":"Kurt D."},{"family":"McGrath","given":"Melissa A."},{"family":"Musacchio","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Wennmacher","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Neubauer","given":"Fritz M."},{"family":"Simon","given":"Sven"},{"family":"Hartkorn","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"SaurEtAl2015","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research (Space Physics)","DOI":"10.1002/2014JA020778","ISSN":"0148-0227","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,1]]},"note":"ADS Bibcode: 2015JGRA..120.1715S","page":"1715-1737","source":"NASA ADS","title":"The search for a subsurface ocean in Ganymede with Hubble Space Telescope observations of its auroral ovals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JGRA..120.1715S","volume":"120"},

  {"id":"SavvaEtAl2020","abstract":"In rotating stratified flows including in the atmosphere and ocean, inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) often coexist with a geostrophically balanced turbulent flow. Advection and refraction by this flow lead to wave scattering, redistributing IGW energy in the position–wavenumber phase space. We give a detailed description of this process by deriving a kinetic equation governing the evolution of the IGW phase-space energy density. The derivation relies on the smallness of the Rossby number characterising the geostrophic flow, which is treated as a random field with known statistics, and makes no assumption of spatial scale separation. The kinetic equation describes energy transfers that are restricted to IGWs with the same frequency, as a result of the timescale separation between waves and flow. We formulate the kinetic equation on the constant-frequency surface – a double cone in wavenumber space – using polar spherical coordinates, and we examine the form of the two scattering cross sections involved, which quantify energy transfers between IGWs with, respectively, the same and opposite directions of vertical propagation. The kinetic equation captures both the horizontal isotropisation and the cascade of energy across scales that result from scattering. We focus our attention on the latter to assess the predictions of the kinetic equation against direct simulations of the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations, finding good agreement.","author":[{"family":"Savva","given":"Miles A.C."},{"family":"Kafiabad","given":"Hossein A."},{"family":"Vanneste","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"SavvaEtAl2020","container-title":"arXiv","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2021.205","ISSN":"23318422","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"1-24","title":"Inertia-gravity-wave scattering by geostrophic turbulence","type":"article-journal"},

This allows us to simultaneously and significantly reduce memory usage and computation time of the SHT. We measure the performance and accuracy of our algorithms. Even though the complexity of the algorithms implemented in SHTns are in $O(N^3)$ (where N is the maximum harmonic degree of the transform), they perform much better than any third party implementation, including lower complexity algorithms, even for truncations as high as N=1023.

For small forcing, this produces a shear layer, which has been studied by Stewartson and is almost invariant along the rotation axis. When the forcing increases, instabilities develop. To study the asymptotic regime (very low Ekman number $E$), we develop a quasi-geostrophic two-dimensional model, whose main original feature is to handle the mass conservation correctly, resulting in a divergent two-dimensional flow, and valid for any container provided that the top and bottom have finite slopes. We use it to derive scalings and asymptotic laws by a simple linear theory, extending the previous analyses to large slopes (as in a sphere), for which we find different scaling laws. For a flat container, the critical Rossby number for the onset of instability evolves as $E^{3/4}$ and may be understood as a Kelvin-Helmoltz shear instability. For a sloping container, the instability is a Rossby wave with a critical Rossby number proportional to $\\beta E^{1/2}$, where $\\beta$ is related to the slope. We also investigate the asymmetry between positive and negative differential rotation and propose corrections for finite Ekman and Rossby numbers. Implemented in a numerical code, our model allows us to study the onset over a broad range of parameters, determining the threshold but also other features such as the spatial structure.

  {"id":"SchaefferEtAl2017","abstract":"We present an attempt to reach realistic turbulent regime in direct numerical simulations of the geodynamo. We rely on a sequence of three convection-driven simulations in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. The most extreme case reaches towards the Earth’s core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl number Pm = 0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number Rm > 500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E = 10−7) at the limit of what is feasible on today’s supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis highlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo theory predictions—all present together in the same simulation—but it also unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth’s core dynamics. In this strong-ﬁeld, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one order of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of magnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast exists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the cylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core). In the interior, the magnetic ﬁeld is strongest, and is associated with a vigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the formation of a reverse polar ﬂux patch at the surface of the shell. Furthermore, the strong magnetic ﬁeld also allows accumulation of light material within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratiﬁcation there. Torsional Alfve´n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the tangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator. Outside the tangent cylinder, the magnetic ﬁeld inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic energy is mostly non-zonal. Spatio-temporal analysis indicates that the low-frequency, non-zonal ﬂow is quite geostrophic (columnar) and predominantly large-scale: an m = 1 eddy spontaneously emerges in our most extreme simulations, without any heterogeneous boundary forcing. Our spatio-temporal analysis further reveals that (i) the low-frequency, large-scale ﬂow is governed by a balance between Coriolis and buoyancy forces—magnetic ﬁeld and ﬂow tend to align, minimizing the Lorentz force; (ii) the high-frequency ﬂow obeys a balance between magnetic and Coriolis forces; (iii) the convective plumes mostly live at an intermediate scale, whose dynamics is driven by a threeterm MAC balance—involving Coriolis, Lorentz and buoyancy forces. However, small-scale ( E1/3) quasi-geostrophic convection is still observed in the regions of low magnetic intensity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"N."},{"family":"Jault","given":"D."},{"family":"Nataf","given":"H.-C."},{"family":"Fournier","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"SchaefferEtAl2017","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggx265","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-29","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Turbulent geodynamo simulations: a leap towards Earth’s core","title-short":"Turbulent geodynamo simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/gji/article/211/1/1/3906752/Turbulent-geodynamo-simulations-a-leap-towards","volume":"211"},

We ﬁnd that inclusion of the magnetic ﬁeld perturbations caused by the interaction with Jupiter’s magnetospheric plasma is important for interpreting Galileo’s magnetic ﬁeld measurements near Europa.

We ﬁnd for the conductivity of Europa’s ocean values of 500 mS/m or larger combined with ocean thicknesses of 100 km and smaller to be most suitable to explain the magnetic ﬂyby data. In summary, this results in the following relation: electrical conductivity × ocean thickness 50 S/m km.

It has been difficult to separate these effects, because there is considerable scatter among GIA models concerning predicted PM rates. Here we develop a new method to estimate GIA PM using data from the GRACE mission. Changes in GRACE degree 2, order 1 spherical harmonic coefficients are due both to GIA and contemporary surface mass load changes. We estimate the surface mass load contribution to degree 2, order 1 coefficients using GRACE data, relying on higher-degree GRACE coefficients that are dominantly affected by surface loads. Then the GIA PM trend is obtained from the difference between observed PM trend (which includes effects from GIA and surface mass loads) and the estimated PM trend mostly associated with surface mass loads. A previous estimate of the GIA PM trend from PM observations for the period 1900–1978 is toward 79.90° W at a speed of 3.53 mas/year (10.91 cm/year). Our new estimate for the GIA trend is in a direction of 61.77° W at a speed of 2.18 mas/year (6.74 cm/year), similar to the observed PM trend during the early twentieth century. This is consistent with the view that the early twentieth-century trend was dominated by GIA and that more recently there is an increasing contribution from contemporary surface mass load redistribution associated with climate change. Our GIA PM also agrees with the linear mean pole during 1900–2017. Contributions from other solid Earth process such as mantle convection would also produce a linear trend in PM and could be included in our GIA estimate.","author":[{"family":"Seo","given":"Ki-Weon"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jae-Seung"},{"family":"Youm","given":"Kookhyoun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianli"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Clark R."}],"citation-key":"Seo2021","container-title":"Journal of Geodesy","DOI":"10.1007/s00190-021-01476-x","ISBN":"0123456789","ISSN":"0949-7714","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,22]]},"page":"40","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","title":"Secular polar motion observed by GRACE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00190-021-01476-x","volume":"95"},

A stably stratiﬁed layer at the top of the core can, however, prevent resonant behavior with gravito-inertial modes by impeding radial motions and promote a strong horizontal ﬂow near the CMB.

  {"id":"Seyed-MahmoudRogister2021","abstract":"We study the following rotational modes of Poincaré Earth models: the tilt-over mode (TOM), the spin-over mode (SOM) and free core nutation (FCN), using first a simple Earth model with a homogeneous and incompressible liquid core (LC) and a rigid mantle (MT). We obtain analytical solutions for the periods of these modes as well as that of the Chandler wobble (CW). We show analytically the distinction between the TOM and the SOM and that the FCN is indeed the same mode as the SOM of a wobbling Earth. The reduced pressure, in terms of which the vector momentum equation is known to reduce to a scalar second-order partial differential equation called the Poincaré equation, is used as the independent variable. Analytical solutions are then found for the displacement eigenfunctions in a meridional plane of the liquid core for the aforementioned modes. We next consider a three-layer Earth model similar to above which also includes a rigid inner core (IC). We first show that analytical solutions exist for the period and eigenfunctions of the CW if the IC is locked to the MT, i.e. they have the same wobbling motion. We show that this is significant as it shows that the CW manifests itself for a Poincaré (incompressible and inviscid LC) wobbling Earth model. We further allow for the inner core to wobble independently and compute numerically the periods and displacement eigenfunctions of the TOM, SOM and FCN, as well as those for still another rotational mode, the inner-core wobble (ICW). Next we show that the presence of the characteristic surfaces intercepted by the inner-core, when computing the period and eigenfunctions of the free inner-core nutation (FICN), may be the reason for the slow (or lack of the) convergence of this mode. Finally, we show that even though the wobbling motion of the mantle is ignored when solving for the frequencies of the ICW and the FICN when Sasao’s approximation is used, the analytical solutions for both these modes yield periods nearly identical to those in the literature for a similar Earth model with mantle allowed to wobble as well. We infer that the Sasao’s approximation, or the severe truncation of the series solution of the field variables, the pressure, the gravitational potential and the components of the displacement vector, may not be adequate to accurately describe the motion in the liquid core during the excitation of the FICN.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Seyed-Mahmoud","given":"B."},{"family":"Rogister","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"Seyed-MahmoudRogister2021","container-title":"Geophysical & Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics","container-title-short":"Geophysical & Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics","DOI":"10.1080/03091929.2020.1845327","ISSN":"0309-1929, 1029-0419","issue":"5-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,2]]},"language":"en","page":"648-673","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rotational modes of Poincaré Earth models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03091929.2020.1845327","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"Shebalin2021","abstract":"The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is measured on and above the crust, while the turbulent dynamo in the outer core produces magnetic ﬁeld values at the core–mantle boundary (CMB). The connection between the two sets of values is usually assumed to be independent of the electrical conductivity in the mantle. However, the turbulent magnetoﬂuid in the Earth’s outer core produces a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld that must induce currents in the lower mantle as it emerges, since the mantle is observed to be electrically conductive. Here, we develop a model to assess the possible effects of mantle electrical conductivity on the magnetic ﬁeld values at the CMB. This model uses a new method for mapping the geomagnetic ﬁeld from the Earth’s surface to the CMB. Since numerical and theoretical results suggest that the turbulent magnetic ﬁeld in the outer core as it approaches the CMB is mostly parallel to this boundary, we assume that this property exists and set the normal component of the model magnetic ﬁeld to zero at the CMB. This leads to a modiﬁcation of the Mauersberger–Lowes spectrum at the CMB so that it is no longer ﬂat, i.e., the modiﬁed spectrum depends on mantle conductance. We examined several cases in which mantle conductance ranges from low to high in order to gauge how CMB magnetic ﬁeld strength and mantle ohmic heat generation may vary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Shebalin","given":"John V."}],"citation-key":"Shebalin2021","container-title":"Fluids","container-title-short":"Fluids","DOI":"10.3390/fluids6110403","ISSN":"2311-5521","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,8]]},"language":"en","page":"403","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mantle Electrical Conductivity and the Magnetic Field at the Core–Mantle Boundary","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5521/6/11/403","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"SibgatullinEtAl2018","abstract":"Internal (inertial) waves in a uniformly stratified (rotating) fluid obey a highly specific dispersion relation that admits their propagation in form of oblique beams, which preserve their inclination to the distinguished direction (prescribed by gravity for internal waves and the angular velocity vector for the inertial waves) upon reflection. In confined domains with sloping walls, repeated reflections of the wave beams lead to concentration of the wave energy at closed loops called wave attractors. The dynamics of wave attractors is best studied in essentially two-dimensional problems (plane or axisymmetric), progressing from the ideal-fluid concept to more realistic ones, with consideration of viscous effects, energy balance and cascades of wave-wave interactions. Development of fully three-dimensional highly nonlinear regimes has not yet been unexplored. The present paper considers direct numerical simulations of inertial wave attractors in an axisymmetric rotating annulus having a trapezoidal cross section and a vertical axis of revolution. The rotating fluid volume is confined between two vertical co-axial cylinders, with truncated cone as a bottom surface. The large-scale forcing is applied to the fluid volume by specific motion of the upper lid. The spectral element method (based on Nek5000 open solver) is used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations in rotating fluid, with the non-slip boundary conditions at all rigid walls, and a prescribed vertical velocity field at the upper lid. We consider two types of forcing. The first one simulates a small-amplitude nutation (Euler-disk-type motion) of the rigid lid, where the vector normal to the lid undergoes precession in such a way that the tip of the vector describes a horizontal circle of small radius around the axis of rotation of the annulus. This motion is modelled by prescribing the vertical velocity field with cosine-shaped running wave in azimuthal direction and linear variation in the radial direction. The response to such forcing mimics some essential features of tidal excitation. We show that attractors are formed only when the sense of nutation in azimuthal direction (in rotating coordinate system) is opposite to the sense of the background rotation (in a fixed laboratory system). In a horizontal cross-section of the flow we see then a rotating pattern with 'Yin-Yang' interplay in laminar mode, and when instability occurs with growth of the amplitude of external forcing, we see the interplay between the large- and small-scale 'Yin-Yang' patterns. The second type of forcing is purely axisymmetric. At the upper lid we prescribe the vertical velocity profile in radial direction, with the amplitude in form of half-wave of the Bessel function, and simple harmonic time dependence. Such forcing excites a purely axisymmetric motion in linear regime. As the forcing increases, the axial symmetry of the inertial-wave motion is broken: in the horizontal cross-section we observe the development of fine-scale 'Mandala' patterns possessing rotational symmetry whose complexity grow with time. In both cases of forcing the triadic resonance is responsible for development of instability, and at sufficiently large forcing we observe a transition to three-dimensional wave turbulence. We show thus for the first time that fully three-dimensional simulations are necessary to capture the essential features of nonlinear regimes in inertial wave attractors in a rotating fluid annulus.","author":[{"family":"Sibgatullin","given":"Ilias"},{"family":"Ermanyuk","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Maas","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiulin"},{"family":"Dauxois","given":"Thierry"}],"citation-key":"SibgatullinEtAl2018","container-title":"Proceedings - 2017 Ivannikov ISPRAS Open Conference, ISPRAS 2017","DOI":"10.1109/ISPRAS.2017.00029","ISBN":"9781538611326","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"137-143","title":"Direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional inertial wave attractors","type":"article-journal","volume":"2018-Janua"},

Thermo-inertial convection is a distinctive flow regime on the border between rotating thermal convection and wave propagation.

To investigate the onset of motion, a perturbation method is used here with an inviscid balance in the leading order and a buoyancy force acting against weak viscous dissipation in the next order of approximation. Analytical evaluation of constituent integral quantities is enabled by applying a Green’s function method for the exact solution of the heat equation following our earlier non-magnetic analysis.

In both cases, explicit expressions for the dependence of the Rayleigh number on the azimuthal wavenumber are derived in the limit of high thermal diffusivity.

  {"id":"Smith1977","abstract":"Elastic‐gravitational normal mode theory is used to study theoretically the free wobble and free nutation of a suite of geophysically plausible rotating slightly elliptical earth models. We principally find that observations of wobble eigenfrequencies are not likely to constrain strongly the structure of the Earth's fluid core, that the results of our calculations, together with Dahlen's estimate of the ocean correction, yield the observed Chandler wobble period within its observational uncertainty and that estimates of wobble excitation by earthquakes based on quasi‐static calculations of the Earth's response are correctly computed. Also we summarize several analytical treatments of both wobble and internal core modes of rotating Earth models and use that information to assess analytically and numerically the approximate theory exploited here. We show that the approximation we use is valid for the Earth's major free wobbles but not for studying internal modes in the fluid core. By exploiting the existence of analytic solutions to certain members of the general class of problems of interest to us here, we have been able to explore the range over which the numerical theory used here is valid. In particular, the theory is adequate to describe the major mantle wobbles of the Earth – namely the Chandler wobble and the nearly diurnal free wobble. It is also adequate to describe the response of the Earth to tidal potentials, at least to the extent that ‘internal’ modes in the fluid core do not participate in the Earth's response. The theory has been demonstrated to be sorely inadequate for two other classes of normal modes: internal core modes and the Chandler Wobble of the solid inner‐core. In both cases the failure of the theory is associated with the inability of our finite representation to adequately represent motion in the fluid. These failures are not evident from inspection of the numerical results alone; their detection was only made possible by the availability of analytic solutions. A corollary of these results is that recent published calculations of internal core modes for rotating geophysically plausible earth models by Crossley (1975) and Shen & Mansinha (1976) are almost surely invalid. The theoretical basis for those studies, like the one exploited here, is wholly inadequate to describe internal core modes. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell.

In contrast to the classical theory of rotating, incompressible fluids in rigid containers, a realistic treatment of the geophysical problem requires allowance for the compressibility of the fluid core, and for the elasticity of the shell (mantle and crust) and inner core. It is shown in this paper that when these realistic properties are included in the model, the governing sub‐seismic wave equation and boundary conditions are fully Hermitean and a general functional governing the problem can be constructed. Compressibility is treated through a decompression factor which multiplies the displacement field to generate a new, solenoidal, displacement vector field, while elasticity of the boundaries is incorporated by means of internal load Love numbers. Both the decompression factor for the fluid core and the internal load Love numbers for the shell and inner core are computed for realistic Earth models. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

Focusing on Enceladus, Titan, Europa, and Ganymede, I use rotating convection theory and numerical simulations to predict ocean currents and the potential for ice-ocean coupling. When the influence of rotation is relatively strong, the oceans have multiple zonal jets, axial convective motions, and most efficient heat transfer at high latitudes. This regime is most relevant to Enceladus and possibly to Titan and may help explain their long-wavelength topography. For a more moderate rotational influence, fewer zonal jets form, Hadley-like circulation cells develop, and heat flux peaks near the equator. This regime is predicted for Europa, where it may help drive geologic activity via thermocompositional diapirism in the ice shell, and is possible for Titan. Weak rotational influence allows concentric zonal flows and overturning cells with no preferred orientation.

  {"id":"SoldatiEtAl2015","abstract":"We conduct joint tomographic inversions of P and S travel time observations to obtain models of delta v_P and delta v_S in the entire mantle. We adopt a recently published method which takes into account the geodynamic coupling between mantle heterogeneity and core-mantle boundary (CMB) topography by viscous flow, where sensitivity of the seismic travel times to the CMB is accounted for implicitly in the inversion (i.e. the CMB topography is not explicitly inverted for). The seismic maps of the Earth's mantle and CMB topography that we derive can explain the inverted seismic data while being physically consistent with each other. The approach involved scaling P-wave velocity (more sensitive to the CMB) to density anomalies, in the assumption that mantle heterogeneity has a purely thermal origin, so that velocity and density heterogeneity are proportional to one another. On the other hand, it has sometimes been suggested that S-wave velocity might be more directly sensitive to temperature, while P heterogeneity is more strongly influenced by chemical composition. In the present study, we use only S-, and not P-velocity, to estimate density heterogeneity through linear scaling, and hence the sensitivity of core-reflected P phases to mantle structure. Regardless of whether density is more closely related to P- or S-velocity, we think it is worthwhile to explore both scaling approaches in our efforts to explain seismic data. The similarity of the results presented in this study to those obtained by scaling P-velocity to density suggests that compositional anomaly has a limited impact on viscous flow in the deep mantle.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Soldati","given":"Gaia"},{"family":"Boschi","given":"Lapo"},{"family":"Mora","given":"Steve Della"},{"family":"Forte","given":"Alessandro M."}],"citation-key":"SoldatiEtAl2015","container-title":"Annals of Geophysics","DOI":"10.4401/ag-6603","ISSN":"2037-416X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,16]]},"language":"en","title":"Tomography of core-mantle boundary and lowermost mantle coupled by geodynamics: joint models of shear and compressional velocity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/6603","volume":"57"},

The experiments are performed in the 13 m diameter, 1 m deep Coriolis rotating tank of the LEGI in Grenoble, France. A global flow rotation is produced by an initial change in the tank rotation speed. It then slowly decays under the effect of Ekman friction, evolving from the turbulent state to the laminar state. It is checked that the Ekman layer itself remains in a quasi-steady state during this decay. The velocity is measured by Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) at two scales: the global rotation in a horizontal plane, and the vertical profile inside the boundary layer, where the three velocity components are obtained by stereoscopic PIV. The friction law is obtained by relating the decay rate of the bulk velocity to the velocity itself. This method is justified by the fact that this bulk velocity is independent of height beyond the top of the boundary layer (a few cm), as expected from the Taylor-Proudman theorem for rotating fluids. The local measurements inside the boundary layer provide profiles of the mean velocity and Reynolds stress components, in particular the cross-isobar angle between the interior and near surface velocities. In the laminar regime, good agreement is obtained with the classical Ekman's theory, which validates the method. In the turbulent regime, the results are found consistent with the classical Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) model based on the von Karman logarithmic layer. Our experiments therefore indicate that this theory, in principle valid for very large Reynolds numbers, is already relevant close to the transitional regimes. A fit of the empirical coefficients A and B appearing in this theory yields A = 3.3 and B = 3.0. Extrapolating the results to the atmospheric case gives a friction velocity u* about 12% higher than the traditional fit for the ABL. We may safely deduce that for the oceanic bottom boundary layer, corresponding to lower Reynolds numbers than the atmosphere, our result provides a correct estimate within 10%. The previous laboratory results of Caldwell et al. [\"A laboratory study of the turbulent Ekman layer,\" Geophys. Fluid Dyn.3, 125-160 (1972)10.1080/03091927208236078] provided frictions velocities about 20% higher than in our experiments, and slightly higher cross-isobar angles. We attribute this difference to the higher vortical Rossby number Rot in those experiments, and maybe also to roughness effects.

  {"id":"SpohnSchubert2003","abstract":"Equilibrium models of heat transfer by heat conduction and thermal convection show that the three satellites of Jupiter—Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—may have internal oceans underneath ice shells tens of kilometers to more than a hundred kilometers thick. A wide range of rheology and heat transfer parameter values and present-day heat production rates have been considered. The rheology was cast in terms of a reference viscosity ␯0 calculated at the melting temperature and the rate of change A of viscosity with inverse homologous temperature. The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity k of ice I has been taken into account by calculating the average conductivity along the temperature proﬁle. Heating rates are based on a chondritic radiogenic heating rate of 4.5 pW kgϪ1 but have been varied around this value over a wide range. The phase diagrams of H2O (ice I) and H2O ϩ 5 wt% NH3 ice have been considered. The ice I models are worst-case scenarios for the existence of a subsurface liquid water ocean because ice I has the highest possible melting temperature and the highest thermal conductivity of candidate ices and the assumption of equilibrium ignores the contribution to ice shell heating from deep interior cooling. In the context of ice I models, we ﬁnd that Europa is the satellite most likely to have a subsurface liquid ocean. Even with radiogenic heating alone the ocean is tens of kilometers thick in the nominal model. If tidal heating is invoked, the ocean will be much thicker and the ice shell will be a few tens of kilometers thick. Ganymede and Callisto have frozen their oceans in the nominal ice I models, but since these models represent the worst-case scenario, it is conceivable that these satellites also have oceans at the present time. The most important factor working against the existence of subsurface oceans is contamination of the outer ice shell by rock. Rock increases the density and the pressure gradient and shifts the triple point of ice I to shallower depths where the temperature is likely to be lower then the triple point temperature. According to present knowledge of ice phase diagrams, ammonia produces one of the largest reductions of the melting temperature. If we assume a bulk concentration of 5 wt% ammonia we ﬁnd that all the satellites have substantial oceans. For a model of Europa heated only by radiogenic decay, the ice shell will be a few tens of kilometers thinner than in the ice I case. The underlying rock mantle will limit the depth of the ocean to 80 –100 km. For Ganymede and Callisto, the ice I shell on top of the H2O–NH3 ocean will be around 60- to 80-km thick and the oceans may be 200- to 350-km deep. Previous models have suggested that efﬁcient convection in the ice will freeze any existing ocean. The present conclusions are different mainly because they are based on a parameterization of convective heat transport in ﬂuids with strongly temperature dependent viscosity rather than a parameterization derived from constant-viscosity convection models. The present parameterization introduces a conductive stagnant lid at the expense of the thickness of the convecting sublayer, if the latter exists at all. The stagnant lid causes the temperature in the sublayer to be warmer than in a comparable constant-viscosity convecting layer. We have further modiﬁed the parameterization to account for the strong increase in homologous temperature, and therefore decrease in viscosity, with depth along an adiabat. This modiﬁcation causes even thicker stagnant lids and further elevated temperatures in the well-mixed sublayer. It is the stagnant lid and the comparatively large temperature in the sublayer that frustrates ocean freezing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Spohn","given":"Tilman"},{"family":"Schubert","given":"Gerald"}],"citation-key":"SpohnSchubert2003","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/S0019-1035(02)00048-9","ISSN":"00191035","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",2]]},"language":"en","page":"456-467","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oceans in the icy Galilean satellites of Jupiter?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019103502000489","volume":"161"},

  {"id":"SreenivasanNarasimhan2017","abstract":"The long-time evolution of a ﬂow structure subject to background rotation and a coaxial uniform magnetic ﬁeld is investigated in this paper. The conditions of magnetic Reynolds number Rm 1 and Rossby number Ro 1 apply, while the condition of magnetic interaction parameter N 1 ensures that nonlinear inertial forces are small in the system. Cylindrical polar coordinates (s, φ, z) are used, where the velocity and the induced magnetic ﬁeld are axisymmetric. Two regimes are analysed in the inviscid limit, that of strong rotation, where the inertial wave frequency is much higher than the Alfvén wave frequency, and that of weak rotation, where the Alfvén wave frequency is dominant. In either regime, the evolution consists of a damped wave-dominated phase followed by a diffusion-dominated phase. For strong rotation, the laws of energy decay in the damped wave phase are obtained by considering the decay of the fast and slow magneto-Coriolis (MC) waves individually. The diffusion-dominated phase obeys the decay laws in the well-known quasistatic approximation. The wave–diffusion transition time scale indicates that the wave phase of decay is very long, so that small-scale turbulence is characterized by damped wave motions. The ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies of the slow MC wave in the early stages of evolution is O(Le2), where Le is the initial ratio of the inertial wave to Alfvén wave time scales. The induced magnetic ﬁeld is hence far more efﬁcient than the velocity in supporting slow MC waves for Le 1. In the regime of weak rotation, the fast and slow MC wave solutions merge and tend to the classical damped Alfvén wave solution. Here, the decay laws in non-rotating magnetohydrodynamic turbulence (Moffatt, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 28, 1967, pp. 571–592) are recovered. Computations of the general solution for the long-time decay of an isolated vortex conﬁrm the theoretical energy scalings as well as the wave–diffusion transition time scale of the kinetic energy. It is shown that a magnetically damped system that initially generates Alfvén waves because of relatively weak rotation can subsequently give rise to MC waves. Small-scale motions of Rm ∼ 1 in the Earth’s core probably generate slow magnetostrophic waves only for Le > 0.1, which suggests that a mean intensity of ∼10 mT or higher is plausible for the toroidal magnetic ﬁeld within the core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Sreenivasan","given":"Binod"},{"family":"Narasimhan","given":"Ghanesh"}],"citation-key":"SreenivasanNarasimhan2017","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","container-title-short":"J.

Fully relativistic simulations are performed by using the Baumgarte-Shibata-Shapiro-Nakamura formalism jointly with the Valencia formulation of the hydrodynamics. This permits us to test the universality of the critical collapse with respect with the matter type by considering the constant equation of state co as a control parameter. We exhibit, for a fixed radial profile of the energy-density contrast, the existence of a critical value ui for the equation of state under which the fluctuation collapses to a black hole and above which it is diluting. It is shown numerically that the mass of the formed black hole, for subcritical solutions, obeys a scaling law M ∝ |ω-ω∗|γ cx \\ui - ui I with a critical exponent 7 independent on the matter type, revealing the universality. Simulations tend to show that, in a cosmological background, this scaling law is no more true for ∗ values very near the threshold ui and that the mass stabilizes to a minimum value. We observe no such breaking of the universality in the case of a Minkowski background. Concerning the spherical collapse in a general way, we explain that considering only the central value for the energy-density contrast can lead to severe interpretation errors when dealing with pressured matter, showing the irrelevance of the top-hat approximation in this case.","author":[{"family":"Staelens","given":"François"},{"family":"Rekier","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Fúzfa","given":"André"}],"citation-key":"StaelensEtAl2019","container-title":"arXiv","ISSN":"23318422","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"license":"All rights reserved","title":"Universality of the spherical collapse with respect with the matter type : the case of a barotropic fluid with constant equation of state","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"StewartShakespeare2024","abstract":"Interactions between the rotating stratified oceanic and atmospheric flows and topography play a fundamental role in Earth's climate. Here we use laboratory experiments in a differentially-heated rotating annulus to explore stratified flow-topography interactions in a dynamical regime of strong background geostrophic turbulence. A localised small-scale topographic ridge is differentially-rotated at a range of angular velocities around the base of the annulus to impose a relative velocity between the stratified fluid and the small ridge. Considering the idealised setup of the laboratory configuration, the experiments exhibit rich dynamics that include, but are not limited to, lee waves, internal bores, baroclinic instabilities, boundary currents, large-scale gyres, blocking, and geostrophic eddies. Despite the complicated nature of the circulations, several bulk properties and features of the system are able to be characterised globally by relatively simple parameters. We find that the most useful parameter for describing the flows is the internal Froude number (Frn), which is the ratio between the imposed ridge velocity and the internal wave phase speed in the stratified fluid. Standing features that are predominantly barotropic and stationary relative to the ridge are only able to occur when the imposed ridge velocity is less than the internal wave phase speed (|Frn|<1). This implies that the flow-topography interactions leading to stationary dynamics are primarily internal stratified processes, which steer the flow and shape the background geostrophic turbulence such that it can support standing barotropic features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Stewart","given":"Kial D."},{"family":"Shakespeare","given":"Callum J."}],"citation-key":"StewartShakespeare2024","container-title":"Geophysical & Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics","DOI":"10.1080/03091929.2024.2311928","ISSN":"0309-1929","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"page":"1-46","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"On stratified flow over a topographic ridge in a rotating annulus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03091929.2024.2311928","volume":"0"},

In four experiments we contrast the heuristic-analytic model (HAM) with alternative accounts. In Experiment 1, the decrease in truth responding was not the result of speakers appearing more deceptive, but was instead attributable to the rater’s processing style. Yet contrary to HAMs, across three experiments we found the decline in bias was not related to the amount of processing time available (Experiment 1-3) or the communication channel (Experiment 2).

In the exploration of ocean moons, especially Europa, there is a need for mathematical models capable of predicting the magnetic fields induced under a variety of conditions, including in the case of asymmetric oceans. Existing models are limited to either spherical symmetry or assume an ocean with infinite conductivity. In this work, we use a perturbation method to derive a semi-analytic result capable of determining the induced magnetic moments for an arbitrary layered body, provided each layer is nearly spherical. Crucially, we find that degree-2 tidal deformation results in changes to the induced dipole moments. We demonstrate application of our results to models of plausible asymmetry from the literature within the oceans of Europa and Miranda and the ionospheres of Callisto and Triton. For the models we consider, we find that in the asymmetric case, the induced magnetic field differs by more than 2nT near the surface of Europa, 0.25–0.5nT at 1R above Miranda and Triton, and is essentially unchanged for Callisto. For Miranda and Triton, this difference is as much as 20%–30% of the induced field magnitude. If measurements near the moons can be made precisely to better than a few tenths of a nT, these values may be used by future spacecraft investigations to characterize asymmetry within the interior of icy moons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Styczinski","given":"Marshall J."},{"family":"Vance","given":"Steven D."},{"family":"Harnett","given":"Erika M."},{"family":"Cochrane","given":"Corey J."}],"citation-key":"StyczinskiEtAl2022","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114840","ISSN":"0019-1035","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"114840","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A perturbation method for evaluating the magnetic field induced from an arbitrary, asymmetric ocean world analytically","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103521004838","volume":"376"},
  {"id":"StyczinskiHarnett2021","abstract":"The five largest planets all have strong intrinsic magnetic fields that interact with their satellites, many of which contain electrically conducting materials on global scales. Conducting bodies exposed to time-varying magnetic fields induce secondary magnetic fields from movement of eddy currents. In the case of spherically symmetric conducting bodies, matching magnetic solutions at the boundary results in relatively simple relations between the excitation field and the induced field. In this work, we determine the more complicated induced magnetic field from a near-spherical conductor, where the outer boundary is expanded in spherical harmonics. Under the approximations that the excitation field is uniform at a single frequency, the product of wavenumber and radius for the body is large, and the average radius of the body is large compared to the perturbation from spherical symmetry, we find that each spherical harmonic in the shape expansion induces discrete magnetic moments that are independent from the other harmonics in the expansion. That is, simple superposition applies to the magnetic moments induced by each perturbation harmonic. We present a table of the magnetic moments induced by each spherical harmonic up to degree 2 in the perturbed shape. We also present a simple formula by which the induced magnetic field may be evaluated for any arbitrary shape described by expanding the radius of the conducting body in spherical harmonics. Unlike the Earth, many moons in the Solar System are tidally locked to their parent bodies, and many also contain saline, subsurface oceans. Conductive material in these moons is therefore expected to be non-spherical. Accounting for the boundary shape of Europa's ocean will be critical for interpretation of Europa Clipper magnetic measurements near the moon, where the effects of quadrupole-and-higher magnetic moments will be most apparent.

We show that three Cassini states associated with the inner core exist.

All three Cassini states are possible if |ω ficn | > 2π∕16.4 year −1 , but only one is possible otherwise. Assuming that the lowest energy state is favored, this transition marks a discontinuity in the tilt angle of the inner core, transiting from −33 ∘ to 17 ∘ as measured with respect to the mantle figure axis, where negative angles indicate a tilt toward the orbit normal. Possible Lunar interior density structures cover a range of ω ficn , from approximately half to twice as large as Ω p , so the precise tilt angle of the inner core remains unknown, though it is likely large because Ω p is within the resonant band of ω ficn . Adopting one specific density model, we suggest an inner core tilt of approximately −17 ∘ . Viscoelastic deformations within the inner core and melt and growth at the surface of a tilted inner core, both neglected in our model, should reduce this amplitude.

We present estimates of the dissipation from viscous friction associated with the differential precession at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), Qcmb, and at the inner core boundary (ICB), Qicb, as a function of the evolving lunar orbit. We focus on the latter and show that, provided the inner core was larger than 100 km, Qicb may have been as high as 1010–1011 W for most of the lunar history for a broad range of core density models. This is larger than the power required to maintain the fluid core in an adiabatic state; therefore, the heat released by the differential precession at the ICB can drive a past lunar dynamo by thermal convection. This dynamo can outlive the dynamo from precession at the CMB and may have shut off only relatively recently. Estimates of the magnetic field strength at the lunar surface are of the order of a few μT, compatible with the lunar paleomagnetic intensities recorded after 3 Ga. We further show that it is possible that a transition of the Cassini state associated with the inner core may have occurred as a result of the evolution of the lunar orbit. The heat flux associated with Qicb can be of the order of a few mW m−2, which should slow down inner core growth and be included in thermal evolution models of the lunar core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Stys","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"StysDumberry2020","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","container-title-short":"J.

In the absence of librations the fluid performs a solid-body rotation together with the cavity. Librations lead to the appearance of steady zonal flow in the whole cylinder and the intensive steady toroidal flows near the cavity corners. If the frequency of librations is twice lower than the mean rotation rate the inertial waves are excited. The oscillating motion associated with the propagation of inertial wave in the fluid bulk leads to the appearance of an additional steady flow in the Stokes boundary layers on the cavity side wall. In this case the heavy particles of the visualizer are assembled on the side wall into ring structures. The patterns are determined by the structure of steady flow, which in turn depends on the number of reflections of inertial wave beams from the cavity side wall. For some frequencies, inertial waves experience spatial resonance, resulting in inertial modes, which are eigenmodes of the cavity geometry. The resonance of the inertial modes modifies the steady flow structure close to the boundary layer that is manifested in the direct rebuilding of patterns. It is shown that the intensity of zonal flow, as well as the intensity of steady flows excited by inertial waves, is proportional to the square of the amplitude of librations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Subbotin","given":"Stanislav"},{"family":"Dyakova","given":"Veronika"}],"citation-key":"SubbotinDyakova2018","container-title":"Microgravity Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Microgravity Sci.

Increasing seismological observations make the understanding of the mineralogy and mechanism for the complex IC texture extremely challenging, and the driving force for the anisotropic texture remains unclear. Under IC conditions, hydrogen becomes highly diffusive like liquid in the hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) solid Fe lattice, which is known as the superionic state. Here, we reveal that H-ion diffusion in superionic Fe-H alloy is anisotropic with the lowest barrier energy along the c-axis. In the presence of an external electric field, the alignment of the Fe-H lattice with the c-axis pointing to the field direction is energetically favorable. Due to this effect, Fe-H alloys are aligned with the c-axis parallel to the equatorial plane by the diffusion of the north–south dipole geomagnetic field into the inner core. The aligned texture driven by the geomagnetic field presents significant seismic anisotropy, which explains the anisotropic seismic velocities in the IC, suggesting a strong coupling between the IC structure and geomagnetic field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Shichuan"},{"family":"He","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Yufeng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jinfeng"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Duck Young"},{"family":"Li","given":"Heping"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Ho-kwang"}],"citation-key":"SunEtAl2023","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-023-37376-1","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,24]]},"language":"en","page":"1656","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Superionic effect and anisotropic texture in Earth’s inner core driven by geomagnetic field","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37376-1","volume":"14"},

Class may be regarded as a problem either in epistemology or in the philosophy of history, but I think that this separation is unwarranted, since if we separate epistemology and the philosophy of history (which is parallel to other such separations characteristic of bourgeois society itself) we cannot possibly avoid the rigidly-posed conundrum known as relativism. In speaking about class (and truth, and class and truth) we are the heirs of two socialist intellectual traditions, profoundly at variance with one another, although often intertwined politically and emotionally. I hope to show that, up to a point, such fusion and confusion is inevitable. All versions of socialist endeavour can and should be classified into two principal kinds, one inaugurated by Rousseau, the other by Marx. The two have opposite visions of the social subject in need of liberation, and these visions have determined everything from rarefied epistemological positions concerning language and consciousness to social and political attitudes concerning wealth, culture, equality, sexuality and much else.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Tamas","given":"G.

This magnetostrophic balance leads to a Taylor state where the spatially averaged azimuthal Lorentz force is compelled to vanish on cylinders aligned with the rotation axis. Any deviation from this state leads to a torsional oscillation, signatures of which have been observed in the Earth's secular variation and are thought to influence length of day variations via angular momentum conservation. In order to investigate the dynamics of torsional oscillations (TOs), we perform several 3-D dynamo simulations in a spherical shell. We find TOs, identified by their propagation at the correct Alfven speed, in many of our simulations. We find that the frequency, location and direction of propagation of the waves are influenced by the choice of parameters. Torsional waves are observed within the tangent cylinder and also have the ability to pass through it. Several of our simulations display waves with core traveltimes of 4-6 yr. We calculate the driving terms for these waves and find that both the Reynolds force and ageostrophic convection acting through the Lorentz force are important in driving TOs.","author":[{"family":"Teed","given":"R.

These waves arise via disturbances to the predominant (magnetostrophic) force balance believed to exist in the core. The coupling of the core and mantle allow TOs to affect the length-of-day of the Earth via angular momentum conservation. Encouraged by previous work, where we were able to observe TOs in geodynamo simulations, we perform 3-D magnetoconvection simulations in a spherical shell in order to reach more Earth-like parameter regimes that proved hitherto elusive. At large Ekman numbers we find that TOs can be present but are typically only a small fraction of the overall dynamics and are often driven by Reynolds forcing at various locations throughout the domain. However, as the Ekman number is reduced to more Earth-like values, TOs become more apparent and can make up the dominant portion of the short timescale flow. This coincides with a transition to regimes where excitation is found only at the tangent cylinder, is delivered by the Lorentz force and gives rise to a periodic Earth-like wave pattern, approximately operating on a 4 to 5 year timescale. The core travel times of our waves also become independent of rotation at low Ekman number with many converging to Earth-like values of around 4 years.","author":[{"family":"Teed","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Chris A."},{"family":"Tobias","given":"Steven M."}],"citation-key":"TeedEtAl2015","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2015.02.045","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"22-31","publisher":"Elsevier B.V.","title":"The transition to Earth-like torsional oscillations in magnetoconvection simulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.02.045","volume":"419"},

  {"id":"Thorpe1999","abstract":"Abstract The onset of instability in monochromatic two-dimensional internal near-inertial gravity waves propagating in an ocean of constant buoyancy frequency and no mean shear is examined for increasing values of the wave steepness s, the product of the wave amplitude, and the vertical wavenumber of the waves. Stability of disturbances to the quasi-steady flow depends on the minimum Richardson number of the flow in the direction of the disturbance vector. The minimum Richardson numbers both of the quasi-steady x-directed flow, Jx (that is, in the horizontal direction of wave propagation), and of the transverse y-directed flow, Jy, may be <1/4 for steepness, s < 1, provided that σ/f is sufficiently close to unity, where σ is the wave frequency and f the Coriolis frequency. For waves of increasing steepness but fixed frequency, it is found that the minimum Richardson number of flow in the y direction, Jy, becomes less than 1/4 before those of flows in other directions, suggesting that disturbances in the y direction, transverse to the wave, may be first to become unstable. Analytical and numerical solutions of the Taylor–Goldstein equation however show that there is a singular neutral mode of the y-directed flow with a maximum Richardson number, Jy, necessary and sufficient for instability, which decreases as s increases. This mode is stationary. Nonstationary singular x-directed neutral modes exist when the minimum Richardson numbers equals 1/4, independent of s (<1). These critical disturbances move in the x direction at speeds that increase roughly linearly with s. In consequence and depending on the relative growth rates and the manner in which wave steepness increases, moving x-directed disturbances will be the first to become unstable as s increases; they may characterize the onset of instability and consequent wave breaking at all values of s < 1. The wavelengths of the first disturbances to become unstable in near-inertial internal waves of a fixed frequency as their steepness increases are then slightly in excess of the vertical wavelength of the internal waves. These disturbances propagate in the positive x direction with speeds which increases with s, approximately as 0.325cs, where c is the horizontal phase speed of the internal wave. The study draws attention to the need to examine whether collective instability, leading to mixing on a scale exceeding that of a single wave, is possible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Thorpe","given":"S.

  {"id":"Toomre1974","abstract":"Serious confusion is evident in the original literature and several review articles from the past decade which have claimed that a second free wobble of the Earth, stemming from gyroscopic coupling with our core fluid, has been detected marginally from latitude or time data. The confusion is betrayed even by the recent labelling of that mode as a nearly diurnal wobble. In fact such a conceivable free mode, as implied for instance by the analysis of Molodenskii, consists fundamentally of a 460‐day retrograde nutation in space of the supposedly misaligned angular momenta of the core and the mantle. This slow spatial coning of even the mantle axis has to have an amplitude roughly 460 times greater than that of the associated body‐related wobble; a motion as large as that would have been noticed long ago if the recent claims of detection of the wobble were sound. Besides helping to rectify that oversight, the present article (i) comments on the somewhat incomplete theories of such a fluid mode in a realistic Earth, (ii) determines that its combined viscous and magnetic time of damping can hardly exceed 103 years, and (iii) estimates the effects of such friction also upon our forced, astronomical nutations. In particular, it appears that the kinematic viscosity of the uppermost core fluid cannot exceed 105 stokes without affecting excessively our observed 18·6‐year principal nutation. Furthermore, the tidal deceleration of the spin rate of the Earth must have carried us through an exact annual resonance with the free nutation roughly 200 My ago; however, even such resonant coning would probably have had an amplitude only comparable to that of the above principal nutation.

  {"id":"Townsend2003","abstract":"Through the solution of Laplace's tidal equations, approximated to describe equatorially trapped wave propagation, analytical expressions are obtained for the angular dependence of pulsation modes in uniformly rotating stars. As the ratio between rotation and pulsation frequencies becomes large, these expressions approach the exact solutions of the governing low-frequency pulsation equations. Four classes of asymptotic solution are found, corresponding to g (gravito-inertial), r (Rossby), Kelvin and Yanai modes. The Kelvin modes arise through the conservation of specific vorticity, much like the r modes, but propagate in the same sense as the rotation; they are found to be the equivalents of prograde sectoral modes. The prograde Yanai modes behave like g modes, as do the retrograde ones if the rotation is sufficiently rapid; otherwise, the latter exhibit the character of r modes. Comparison between asymptotic and numerical solutions to the tidal equations reveals that the former converge rapidly towards the latter, for g and Yanai modes. The convergence is slower for Kelvin and r modes, as these become equatorially trapped only when the rotation is very rapid. It is argued that the utility of the asymptotic solutions does not rest on their accuracy alone, but also on the valuable physical insights that they are capable of providing.","author":[{"family":"Townsend","given":"R.

  {"id":"Triana2019","abstract":"The Earth is a rapidly rotating body. The centrifugal pull makes its shape resemble a flattened ellipsoid and Coriolis forces support waves in its fluid core, known as inertial waves. These waves can lead to global oscillations, or modes, of the fluid. Periodic variations of the Earth's rotation axis (nutations) can lead to an exchange of angular momentum between the mantle and the fluid core and excite these inertial modes. In addition to viscous torques that exist regardless of the shape of the boundaries, the small flattening of the core-mantle boundary allows inertial modes to exert pressure torques on the mantle. These torques effectively couple the rigid-body dynamics of the Earth with the fluid dynamics of the fluid core. Here we present the first high-resolution numerical model that solves simultaneously the rigid body dynamics of the mantle and the Navier-Stokes equation for the liquid core. This method takes naturally into account dissipative processes in the fluid that are ignored in current nutation models. We find that the Free Core Nutation mode, mostly a toroidal fluid flow if the mantle has a large moment of inertia, enters into resonance with nearby modes if the mantle's moment of inertia is reduced. These mode interactions seem to be completely analogous to the ones discovered in 2006 by D. Schmitt in a uniformly rotating ellipsoid with varying flattening.","author":[{"family":"Triana","given":"Santiago Andrés"},{"family":"Rekier","given":"Jérémy"},{"family":"Trinh","given":"Antony"},{"family":"Dehant","given":"Veronique"}],"citation-key":"Triana2019","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggz212","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"1071-1086","title":"The coupling between inertial and rotational eigenmodes in planets with liquid cores","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/218/2/1071/5487516","volume":"218"},

Yet another set of waves, appearing as retrograde-propagating, equatorially antisymmetric vorticity waves, has also been observed but their identification remained elusive. Here, through a numerical model implemented as an eigenvalue problem, we provide evidence supporting the identification of those waves as a class of inertial eigenmodes, distinct from the Rossby-mode class, with radial velocities comparable to the horizontal ones deep in the convective zone but still small compared to the horizontal velocities toward the surface.

In the process, the natural modes undergo significant variations. It is shown that both phenomena can be described in a unified manner from the singularities of the mapping from the complex parameter plane into the complex frequency plane. In particular, the formation of a saddle point in the frequency plane and a branch point in the parameter space is the basis for explaining the properties associated with these phenomena. The question of sensitivity of the system response near such singularities is subsequently examined. It is shown that the development of a branch point singularity in the complex parameter plane can cause large or even infinite sensitivity of the system about this point, depending on the distance of the branch point from the real axis in the parameter space. It is further shown that mode localization is also associated with the appearance of a branch point near the real axis of the complex parameter plane, which causes the large sensitivity that characterizes the phenomenon.

However, Europa probably formed at much colder temperatures, meaning that Europa plausibly ended accretion as a mixture containing water-ice and/or hydrated silicates. Here, we use numerical models to describe the thermal evolution of Europa’s interior assuming low initial temperatures (~200 to 300 kelvin).

  {"id":"Tyler2014","abstract":"This study illuminates scenarios whereby the heat produced by the dissipation of ocean tides is significant in the heat budgets maintaining liquid oceans on icy satellites in the outer Solar System. It has been shown in previous work that ocean tides, if resonantly forced, can supply heat at or exceeding the rates necessary for maintaining these oceans. It has also been shown that because of feedbacks these resonant configurations may be unavoidable under typical situations. This study extends from the previous work and seeks to examine the full set of dynamically-consistent ocean tidal solutions to describe the parameter dependencies that may cause one ocean to become trapped in such a vigorous ocean state while allowing another to freeze-why do some of these satellites have oceans, and others do not? It is found that even with no other sources of heat, a liquid ocean on many of these satellites would be maintained by ocean tidal heat because the process of freezing (which changes the thickness of the remaining liquid ocean and thereby the eigenmodes) would push the ocean into a resonant configuration, with the associated increase in heat production preventing further freezing and stabilizing the configuration. An ocean on Io or Mimas would suffer extreme tides (with heat generated exceeding 1W/m2) unless an implausibly large volume of water were present to lift the eigenmodes of the configuration out of resonance with the tidal forces. Europa can maintain a thick (~100km) ocean due to an obliquity-forced tidal resonance, while parameters for most other satellites suggest eccentricity-driven resonance scenarios involving much thinner ocean thicknesses (1-10skm). But these thin ocean thickness in the latter scenarios will be altered by ice cover: as the ice cover damps the ocean tidal response, significant heat is still generated which would stall freezing but the ocean thicknesses are modified to larger values than would be expected without ice cover.","author":[{"family":"Tyler","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"Tyler2014","container-title":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2014.08.037","ISSN":"10902643","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"358-385","publisher":"Elsevier Inc.","title":"Comparative estimates of the heat generated by ocean tides on icy satellites in the outer solar system","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2014.08.037","volume":"243"},
  {"id":"Tyler2018","abstract":"Given Cassini observations of a large and unexplained endogenic heat source, the subsurface ocean on Enceladus is an important test bed for modeling icy-satellite ocean tides and the dissipative heat generated. Here we revisit and expand estimates of the ocean tidal power (heating rate) to describe how the power depends on input parameter and process assumptions. The approach taken in this (and previous) work by this author is that the dissipation process in Enceladus’ ocean is unknown and cannot be reliably modeled from first principles. Considered instead are generic dissipation forms that cover specific physical dissipation processes as special cases (specific cases described here include linear/nonlinear drag, eddy viscosity, visoelastic ice coupling, and vertical wave damping). The justification for basing conclusions primarily on the generic (rather than specific) dissipation forms is that whatever the ocean dissipation process, it must draw from the stored energy (kinetic or potential) in the ocean tidal response, and this process must have an associated time scale for the dissipation to take place. By treating this time scale (as well as the Lamb number/wave speed) as free parameters, millions of tidal solutions are calculated to sample the full domain of tidal scenarios that arrive from different combinations of these two parameters, as well as the assumed dissipation form. Conclusions drawn from the general behavior in this larger solution domain are then considered to be more robust than conclusions drawn from the subdomain that assumes the validity of a specific physical dissipation process. The results show plausible states whereby the ocean tides (even if Enceladus is covered with thick ice) generate the observed heat flux. While the same results show that low-power, non-resonant states are also allowed, an argument is presented that these low-power states may not be stable in the presence of secular trends (e.g. cooling, stratification). Rather, self-tuned resonance stabilizes the tidal configuration in a near-resonant forced state with high power and dissipative heat.","author":[{"family":"Tyler","given":"Robert H"}],"citation-key":"Tyler2018","container-title":"Icarus","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2020.113821","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"Elsevier Inc","title":"Heating of Enceladus due to the Dissipation of Ocean Tides","type":"article-journal"},

Uptake of salt to a warmed parcel of water from the seafloor environment causes upwellings to lose buoyancy before reaching the base of the overlying ice, implying a tendency toward ocean stratification. We make an analogy to double-diffusive convecting systems observed in the Red Sea and elsewhere in Earth's waters. Using currently understood parameterizations for onset and stability, we estimate a range of temperatures and salinities for which double-diffusive convection may occur in Europa's ocean. In the Red Sea, boundary layers separating convecting zones have been observed to move upward as the lower layer acquires heat and salt. We examine the possibility of stratification and double-diffusive convection as mechanisms for heat storage in Europa's ocean, and possible correlation with recently inferred changes in ice surface alteration style over the last 30–80 Myr.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Vance","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Brown","given":"J.

  {"id":"VanceEtAl2014","abstract":"The large icy moons of Jupiter contain vast quantities of liquid water, a key ingredient for life. Ganymede and Callisto are weaker candidates for habitability than Europa, in part because of the model-based assumption that high-pressure ice layers cover their seafloors and prevent significant water–rock interaction. Water–rock interactions may occur, however, if heating at the rock–ice interface melts the high pressure ice. Highly saline fluids would be gravitationally stable, and might accumulate under the ice due to upward migration, refreezing, and fractionation of salt from less concentrated liquids. To assess the influence of salinity on Ganymede׳s internal structure, we use available phase-equilibrium data to calculate activity coefficients and predict the freezing of water ice in the presence of aqueous magnesium sulfate. We couple this new equation of state with thermal profiles in Ganymede׳s interior—employing recently published thermodynamic data for the aqueous phase—to estimate the thicknesses of layers of ice I, III, V, and VI. We compute core and silicate mantle radii consistent with available constraints on Ganymede׳s mass and gravitational moment of inertia. Mantle radii range from 800 to 900km for the values of salt and heat flux considered here (4–44mWm−2 and 0 to 10wt% MgSO4). Ocean concentrations with salinity higher than 10wt% have little high pressure ice. Even in a Ganymede ocean that is mostly liquid, achieving such high ocean salinity is permissible for the range of likely S/Si ratios. However, elevated salinity requires a smaller silicate mantle radius to satisfy mass and moment-of-inertia constraints, so ice VI is always present in Ganymede׳s ocean. For lower values of heat flux, oceans with salinity as low as 3wt% can co-exist with ice III. Available experimental data indicate that ice phases III and VI become buoyant for salinity higher than 5wt% and 10wt%, respectively. Similar behavior probably occurs for ice V at salinities higher than 10wt%. Flotation can occur over tens of kilometers of depth, indicating the possibility for upward ‘snow’ or other exotic modes of heat and material transport.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vance","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Bouffard","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Choukroun","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Sotin","given":"Christophe"}],"citation-key":"VanceEtAl2014","container-title":"Planetary and Space Science","container-title-short":"Planetary and Space Science","DOI":"10.1016/j.pss.2014.03.011","ISSN":"0032-0633","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,1]]},"page":"62-70","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ganymede׳s internal structure including thermodynamics of magnesium sulfate oceans in contact with ice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063314000695","volume":"96"},

Model results suggest, for Europa, that combinations of geophysical parameters might be used to distinguish an oxidized ocean dominated by MgSO4 from a more reduced ocean dominated by NaCl.

The low-density rocky core of Enceladus may comprise hydrated minerals or anhydrous minerals with high porosity. Cassini gravity data for Titan indicate a high tidal potential Love number (k2>0.6), which requires a dense internal ocean (ρocean>1,200 kg m−3) and icy lithosphere thinner than 100 km. In that case, Titan may have little or no high-pressure ice, or a surprisingly deep water-rock interface more than 500 km below the surface, covered only by ice VI. Ganymede's water-rock interface is the deepest among known ocean worlds, at around 800 km. Its ocean may contain multiple phases of high-pressure ice, which will become buoyant if the ocean is sufficiently salty.

However, the phase and amplitude responses of the induced fields will be influenced by the natural depth-dependence of the electrical conductivity. Here, we examine the amplitudes and phase delays for magnetic diffusion in modeled oceans of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. For spherically symmetric configurations, we consider thermodynamically consistent interior structures that include realistic electrical conductivity along the oceans' adiabatic temperature profiles. Conductances depend strongly on salinity, especially in the large moons. The induction responses of the adiabatic profiles differ from those of oceans with uniform conductivity set to values at the ice–ocean interface, or to the mean values of the adiabatic profile, by more than 10% for some signals. We also consider motionally induced magnetic fields generated by convective fluid motions within the oceans, which might optimistically be used to infer ocean flows or, pessimistically, act to bias the ocean conductivity inversions. Our upper-bound scaling estimates suggest this effect may be important at Europa and Ganymede, with a negligible contribution at Callisto. Based on end-member ocean compositions, we quantify the magnetic induction signals that might be used to infer the oxidation state of Europa's ocean and to investigate stable liquids under high-pressure ices in Ganymede and Callisto. Fully exploring this parameter space for the sake of planned missions requires thermodynamic and electrical conductivity measurements in fluids at low temperature and to high-salinity and pressure as well as modeling of motional induction responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Vance","given":"S.

The primary objective of possible future missions to Europa is the unambiguous detection and characterization of a subsurface ocean. The thickness of the overlying icy shell provides important information on the thermal evolution of the satellite and on the interaction between the ocean and the surface, the latter being fundamental for astrobiology. However, the thickness is not well known, and estimates range from several hundred of meters to some ten of kilometers. Here, we investigate the use of libration (rotation variation) observations to study the interior structure of Europa and in particular its icy shell. A dynamical libration model is developed, which includes gravitational coupling between the icy shell and the heavy solid interior. The amplitude of the main libration signal at 3.55 days (the orbital period) is shown to depend on Europa’s shape and structure. Models of the interior structure of Europa are constructed and the equatorial ﬂattening of the internal layers, which are key parameters for the libration, are calculated by assuming that Europa is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Europa’s ﬂattened shape is assumed to be due to rotation and permanent tides, and we extend the classical Radau equation for rotationally ﬂattened bodies to include also tidal deformation. We show that the presence of an ocean increases the amplitude of libration by about 10%, depending mainly on the thickness of the icy shell.

  {"id":"VanHoolstEtAl2009","abstract":"Cassini radar observations show that Titan’s spin is slightly faster than synchronous spin. Angular momentum exchange between Titan’s surface and the atmosphere over seasonal time scales corresponding to Saturn’s orbital period of 29.5 year is the most likely cause of the observed non-synchronous rotation. We study the effect of Saturn’s gravitational torque and torques between internal layers on the lengthof-day (LOD) variations driven by the atmosphere. Because static tides deform Titan into an ellipsoid with the long axis approximately in the direction to Saturn, non-zero gravitational and pressure torques exist that can change the rotation rate of Titan. For the torque calculation, we estimate the ﬂattening of Titan and its interior layers under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The gravitational forcing by Saturn, due to misalignment of the long axis of Titan with the line joining the mass centers of Titan and Saturn, reduces the LOD variations with respect to those for a spherical Titan by an order of magnitude. Internal gravitational and pressure coupling between the ice shell and the interior beneath a putative ocean tends to reduce any differential rotation between shell and interior and reduces further the LOD variations by a few times. For the current estimate of the atmospheric torque, we obtain LOD variations of a hydrostatic Titan that are more than 100 times smaller than the observations indicate when Titan has no ocean as well as when a subsurface ocean exists. Moreover, Saturn’s torque causes the rotation to be slower than synchronous in contrast to the Cassini observations. The calculated LOD variations could be increased if the atmospheric torque is larger than predicted and or if fast viscous relaxation of the ice shell could reduce the gravitational coupling, but it remains to be studied if a two order of magnitude increase is possible and if these effects can explain the phase difference of the predicted rotation variations. Alternatively, the large differences with the observations may suggest that non-hydrostatic effects in Titan are important. In particular, we show that the amplitude and phase of the calculated rotation variations are similar to the observed values if non-hydrostatic effects could strongly reduce the equatorial ﬂattening of the ice shell above an internal ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"T."},{"family":"Rambaux","given":"N."},{"family":"Karatekin","given":"Ö."},{"family":"Baland","given":"R.-M."}],"citation-key":"VanHoolstEtAl2009","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2008.11.009","ISSN":"00191035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3]]},"language":"en","page":"256-264","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The effect of gravitational and pressure torques on Titan's length-of-day variations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019103508003977","volume":"200"},

  {"id":"VanHoolstEtAl2013","abstract":"The gravitational force exerted by a central planet deforms its orbiting moons (tides) and periodically changes their rotation (librations). Tides and librations of large icy satellites rotating synchronously with their orbital motion are usually studied separately but we here show that tides strongly reduce the libration amplitude of large icy satellites with a subsurface ocean. Moreover, libration also slightly changes the tides. Periodic tides affect libration in three ways: first the periodic tidal bulges modify the gravitational torque exerted by the central planet on the satellite, secondly torques between the periodic tidal bulges of a solid layer and the static shape of another solid layer couple the libration of the ice shell and solid interior, and thirdly, the zonal tides periodically change the polar moment of the satellite, which acts as the inertia for rotational motion. We develop a formalism to include these elastic effects in the study of librations and calculate the amplitudes of the longitudinal librations at orbital period for the largest icy satellites in the Solar System: Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan. Without a subsurface ocean, elastic effects on libration are of the order of a few percent. However, if a subsurface ocean exists as indicated by several observations for the satellites considered, elastic tides have a crucial effect. If the solid layers of the satellites are considered rigid, the libration amplitude is at least one order of magnitude larger than for an entirely solid satellite. Periodic elastic tidal deformations of the layers, in particular of the ice shell, counterbalance this large increase and keep the libration amplitude at the level of the libration of the satellite without subsurface ocean. Besides gravitationally forced librations, seasonal variations in the atmosphere of Titan also cause the rotation of Titan to change on a seasonal timescale. We show that tidal elastic effects can strongly increase the amplitude of these long-term variations in the rotation rate by a factor of about four with respect to a rigid shell. We predict that these variations can have an amplitude above the detection limit of the Cassini radar.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Hoolst","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Baland","given":"Rose-Marie"},{"family":"Trinh","given":"Antony"}],"citation-key":"VanHoolstEtAl2013","container-title":"Icarus","container-title-short":"Icarus","DOI":"10.1016/j.icarus.2013.05.036","ISSN":"0019-1035","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"299-315","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"On the librations and tides of large icy satellites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103513002364","volume":"226"},

  {"id":"VanOers2016","abstract":"Enceladus, an enigmatic satellite. It orbits Saturn among many other moons, but the observations by Cassini of Enceladus were perhaps the most eagerly awaited. Enceladus did not disappoint: After Cassini's arrival in the Saturnian system interest has surged for this tiny moon. Many fascinating phenomena are taking place and Cassini has been observing these phenomena since 2005. From its rich and diverse surface, to its connection with Saturn's E-ring, to its high albedo; all are special phenomena. What makes Enceladus unique, however, is the region near its south pole. There, geysers spew material, including salts, from the interior of the satellite into space through openings in its icy crust. These openings or cracks are called ``tiger stripes'' and their orientation and position prove to be difficult to explain. The area near these tiger stripes is anomalously hot, with temperatures reaching far higher than anticipated. These high temperatures indicate heat is being transported from the interior to the surface, but this happens only near the south pole. The observed heating output is much larger than can be explained by current models for planetary heating. These observations make Enceladus and especially its south pole one of the most fascinating places in our Solar system. One special feature on Enceladus is its subsurface sea. Enceladus' subsurface sea is likely confined to the southern latitudes. Since the tiger stripes are located at the South pole and Enceladus' subsurface sea is likely confined to the region below the South pole, these two features seem linked. Did Enceladus' subsurface sea play a role in the formation of the tiger stripes? ince the field of ocean dynamics is very large, attention is restricted to one type of motion in the ocean: wave attractors. A wave attractor is an attractor for internal waves. These are waves that have their maximum displacement in the interior of a fluid. This is different from surface waves, which have their maximum displacement at the surface. These internal waves can only exist when the fluid in which they propagate is stratified in density, i.e. the density decreases continuously in the direction opposite to gravity, or angular momentum. Such a stratified fluid is a stable system and occurs in many places in the Earth's oceans. Fluid bodies in nature are often stably stratified in density due to differences in temperature or salt concentration. This provides these fluid bodies with a restoring force in terms of gravity that is absent in homogeneous fully-contained fluids. This restoring force points in a particular direction (radially for the density-stratified fluid), which renders the fluid anisotropic. Perturbations of such stably stratified fluids appear as waves that orient themselves to the anisotropic direction; i.e. they propagate under a particular fixed direction that is inclined with the anisotropy direction. Waves of given frequency (e.g. tides) preserve this inclination when reflecting from any boundary, in particular also when reflecting from a sloping boundary. The consequence of this constraint is that for almost any shape of basin, these waves are focused onto a particular limit orbit, called wave attractor. The focusing on an attractor is accompanied by an intensification of the wave field, such that intense shearing motion is confined to the immediate vicinity of the wave attractor. The two requirements for wave attractors to exist are tides, which excite internal waves, and a stratification, which carries the internal waves. Enceladus experiences tides due to its eccentric orbit. The stratification can be in angular momentum, certainly present for a rotating Enceladus, or in density, which is created by salts and these have been observed in the geysers, or a combination of both. So the two main ingredients for wave attractors to exist are present on Enceladus. On Enceladus the top of the basin is formed by the icy crust above its south polar sea. The locations of the tiger stripes could be those locations where the wave attractor reflects from this top boundary. The wave attractors focusses energy on its path and the elevated temperatures at the tiger stripes could be due to the wave attractors. The wave attractors allow the phenomena of the tiger stripes and the localized heat output to be explained by processes in the interior of a fluid and ties the observations of salts in the geysers and Enceladus' eccentric orbit to these features. Wave attractors provide a unique approach in the field of planetary sciences, not only because they are a new idea in this field, but also because a direct relation between processes in an interior sea and the (observed) behaviour of an icy crust are used to explain observed features on an icy crust. Furthermore, wave attractors might have applications at other icy satellites. The so-called chaos terrain on Europa might be caused by an wave attractor that changes its path due to changing boundaries of the liquid beneath the chaos terrain.","author":[{"family":"Van Oers","given":"A.M."}],"citation-key":"VanOers2016","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"Wave Attractors on Enceladus","type":"thesis"},

In the deep ocean, tides supply much of the mechanical energy required to sustain mixing via the generation of internal waves, known as internal tides, whose fate—the relative importance of their local versus remote breaking into turbulence—remains uncertain. Here, we combine a semi-analytical model of internal tide generation with satellite and in situ measurements to show that from an energetic viewpoint, small-scale internal tides, hitherto overlooked, account for the bulk (>50%) of global internal tide generation, breaking and mixing. Furthermore, we unveil the pronounced geographical variations of their energy proportion, ignored by current parameterisations of mixing in climate-scale models. Based on these results, we propose a physically consistent, observationally supported approach to accurately represent the dissipation of small-scale internal tides and their induced mixing in climate-scale models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Vic","given":"Clément"},{"family":"Naveira Garabato","given":"Alberto C."},{"family":"Green","given":"J.

We apply the method to investigate the normal modes of fully compressible, rotating and diffusionless fluids. We consider an idealized model, which fairly reproduces the density variations in the Earth’s liquid core and Jupiter-like gaseous planets. We successfully benchmark the results against standard finite-element computations. Notably, we find that the quasi-geostrophic inertial modes can be significantly modified by compressibility, even in moderately compressible interiors.

  {"id":"VidalEtAl","abstract":"Acoustic eigenmodes are often used to passively infer physical properties of the interiors of rotating planets and stars. Acoustic wave imaging has been also introduced in ﬂuid dynamics. The experimental technique consists in observing and analysing the splitting in frequency of the acoustic modes, by solving an inverse problem. For instance, the presence of an (unknown) rotational proﬁle disturbs the acoustic spectrum. Moreover, a topographic splitting is often superimposed on the rotational splitting. Indeed, rotating celestial objects are rather ellipsoidal than spherical at the leading order, as well as laboratory experiments which are weakly non-spherical (due to mechanical deformations). Rotation and topography should be taken into account simultaneously, but the acoustic problem does not admit exact solutions in the presence of rotation. Fully numerical solutions are often computed. However, they cannot be easily combined with inversion schemes to yield robust results. Hence, the usual approach is to consider small perturbations to non-rotating solutions. As an alternative, we present a new description of the compressible modes, relying on the method of weighted residuals. Here, we present a new spectral method to describe potential ﬂows in triaxial ellipsoids. It relies on an explicit Galerkin expansion, made of global polynomials expressed in Cartesian coordinates. We illustrate this method by considering the canonical situation of diﬀusionless acoustic modes in an homogeneous, compressible and homentropic ﬂuid ellipsoid at rest. The pressure satisﬁes a Dirichlet condition (sound soft boundary). We validate our results against fully numerical simulations performed with the commercial software comsol, showing a perfect quantitative agreement.

  {"id":"VidalSchaeffer2015","abstract":"Seismic waves sensitive to the outermost part of the Earth's liquid core seem to be affected by a stably stratified layer at the core-mantle boundary. Such a layer could have an observable signature in both long-term and short-term variations of the magnetic field of the Earth, which are used to probe the flow at the top of the core. Indeed, with the recent SWARM mission, it seems reasonable to be able to identify waves propagating in the core with period of several months, which may play an important role in the large-scale dynamics. In this paper, we characterize the influence of a stratified layer at the top of the core on deep quasi-geostrophic (Rossby) waves. We compute numerically the quasi-geostrophic eigenmodes of a rapidly rotating spherical shell, with a stably stratified layer near the outer boundary. Two simple models of stratification are taken into account, which are scaled with commonly adopted values of the Brunt-V{\\\"a}is{\\\"a}l{\\\"a} frequency in the Earth's core. In the absence of magnetic field, we find that both azimuthal wavelength and frequency of the eigenmodes control their penetration into the stratified layer: the higher the phase speed, the higher the permeability of the stratified layer to the wave motion. We also show that the theory developed by Takehiro and Lister [2001] for thermal convection extends to the whole family of Rossby waves in the core. Adding a magnetic field, the penetrative behaviour of the quasi-geostrophic modes (the so-called fast branch) is insensitive to the imposed magnetic field and only weakly sensitive to the precise shape of the stratification. Based on these results, the large-scale and high frequency modes (1 to 2 month periods) may be detectable in the geomagnetic data measured at the Earth's surface, especially in the equatorial area where the modes can be trapped.","author":[{"family":"Vidal","given":"Jérémie"},{"family":"Schaeffer","given":"Nathanaël"}],"citation-key":"VidalSchaeffer2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,28]]},"page":"1-22","title":"Quasi-geostrophic modes in the Earth's fluid core with an outer stably stratified layer","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07006"},

  {"id":"Walterova2017","abstract":"© 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. The majority of confirmed terrestrial exoplanets orbits close to their host stars and their evolution was likely altered by tidal interaction. Nevertheless, due to their viscoelastic properties on the tidal frequencies, their response cannot be described exactly by standardly employed constant-lag models. We therefore introduce a tidal model based on the numerical evaluation of a continuum mechanics problem describing the deformation of viscoelastic (Maxwell or Andrade) planetary mantles subjected to external force. We apply the method on a model Earth-size planet orbiting a low-mass star and study the effect of the orbital eccentricity, the mantle viscosity and the chosen rheology on the tidal dissipation, the complex Love numbers and the tidal torque. The number of stable spin states (i.e., zero tidal torque) grows with increasing mantle viscosity, similarly to the analytical model of Correia et al. (Astron Astrophys 571:A50, 2014) for homogeneous bodies. This behavior is only slightly influenced by the rheology used. Similarly, the Love numbers do not distinctly depend on the considered rheological model. The increase in viscosity affects the amplitude of their variations. The tidal heating described by the Maxwell rheology attains local minima associated with low spin-orbit resonances, with depth and shape depending on both the eccentricity and the viscosity. For the Andrade rheology, the minima at low resonances are very shallow and the tidal heating for all viscosities resembles a “fluid limit.” The tidal heating is the quantity influenced the most by the rheology, having thus possible impact on the internal thermal evolution.","author":[{"family":"Walterová","given":"M."},{"family":"Běhounková","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Walterova2017","container-title":"Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy","DOI":"10.1007/s10569-017-9772-x","ISSN":"15729478","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"235-256","title":"Tidal effects in differentiated viscoelastic bodies: a numerical approach","type":"article-journal","volume":"129"},

We find that the inner core subrotated at least 0.1° from 1969 to 1971, in contrast to superrotation of ~0.29° from 1971 to 1974. These observations contradict models of steady inner core rotation and models that posit much faster rotation rates. The reversal of polarity, timing, and rotation rates is consistent with a model of oscillations about an equilibrium with gravitational locking of the mantle and inner core due to lateral density variations. The model, which has a 6-year period, can explain the variation in the length of day, which has oscillated fairly steadily for the past decades. Inner core oscillation would also allow interpretations of causal connections between inner core and mantle lateral variations, which are problematic if the inner core consistently superrotates.\n          , \n            Seismic observations suggest that Earth’s inner core oscillates, rather than superrotates, relative to the mantle and crust.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Vidale","given":"John E."}],"citation-key":"WangVidale2022","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Sci.

Here, we use low altitude MESSENGER data covering the entire mission period to construct spherical harmonic models based on various spatial norms. Although we find a dominantly axisymmetric field, our models nevertheless include detectable deviations from axisymmetry. These non-axisymmetric features appear at high latitudes, resembling intense geomagnetic flux patches at Earth's core-mantle boundary. Based on this core field morphology, we then attempt to infer Mercury's internal structure. More specifically, assuming that Mercury's high-latitude non-axisymmetric features are concentrated by downwellings at the edge of the planet's inner core tangent cylinder, and accounting for the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of Mercury's core, we establish a relation between the inner core size and the thickness of the stratified layer. Considering plausible ranges, we propose that Mercury's inner core size is about 500–660 km, which corresponds to a stratified layer thickness of 880–500 km, respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wardinski","given":"I."},{"family":"Amit","given":"H."},{"family":"Langlais","given":"B."},{"family":"Thébault","given":"E."}],"citation-key":"WardinskiEtAl2021","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","DOI":"10.1029/2020JE006792","ISSN":"2169-9100","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021.

  {"id":"Wei2016","abstract":"For understanding magnetic effects on dynamical tides, we study the rotating magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) flow driven by harmonic forcing. The linear responses are analytically derived in a periodic box under the local WKB approximation. Both the kinetic and Ohmic dissipations at the resonant frequencies are calculated and the various parameters are investigated. Although magnetic pressure may be negligible compared to thermal pressure, magnetic field can be important for the first-order perturbation, e.g. dynamical tides. It is found that magnetic field splits the resonant frequency, namely the rotating hydrodynamic flow has only one resonant frequency but the rotating MHD flow has two, one positive and the other negative. In the weak field regime the dissipations are asymmetric around the two resonant frequencies and this asymmetry is more striking with a weaker magnetic field. It is also found that both the kinetic and Ohmic dissipations at the resonant frequencies are inversely proportional to the Ekman number and the square of wavenumber. The dissipation at the resonant frequency on small scales is almost equal to the dissipation at the non-resonant frequencies, namely the resonance takes its effect on the dissipation at intermediate length scales. Moreover, the waves with phase propagation perpendicular to magnetic field are much more damped. It is also interesting to find that the frequency-averaged dissipation is constant. This result suggests that in compact objects magnetic effects on tidal dissipation should be considered.","author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Xing"}],"citation-key":"Wei2016","container-title":"The Astrophysical Journal","DOI":"10.3847/0004-637x/828/1/30","ISSN":"1538-4357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"30","publisher":"IOP Publishing","title":"Calculating Rotating Hydrodynamic and Magnetohydrodynamic Waves To Understand Magnetic Effects on Dynamical Tides","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/828/1/30","volume":"828"},

  {"id":"Wicht2002","abstract":"Speculation about its possible super-rotation has drawn the attention of many geophysical researchers to the Earth’s inner core. An issue of special interest for geodynamo modelling is the inﬂuence of the inner-core conductivity. It has been suggested that the ﬁnite magnetic diffusivity of the inner core prevents more frequent reversals of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. We explore the possible inﬂuence of the inner-core conductivity by comparing convection-driven 3D dynamo simulations with insulating or conducting inner cores (CIC) at various parameters. The inﬂuence on the ﬁeld structure in the outer core is only marginal. The time behaviour of dipole-dominated non-reversing dynamos is also little affected. Concerning reversing dynamos, the inner-core conductivity reduces the number of short dipole-polarity intervals with a typical length of a few thousand years. Reversals are always correlated with low dipole strength and these short intervals are found in periods where the dipole moment stays low. Polarity intervals longer than about 10,000 years, where the dipole moment has time recover in strength, are equally likely in insulating and CIC models. Since these latter intervals are of more geophysical relevance, we conclude that the inﬂuence of the inner-core conductivity on Earth-like reversal sequences is insigniﬁcant for the dynamo model employed here. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"WichtEtAl2020","abstract":"Recent precise measurements of Jupiter’s and Saturn’s gravity ﬁelds help constraining the properties of the zonal ﬂows in the outer envelopes of these planets. The link is provided by a simpliﬁed dynamic equation, which connects zonal ﬂows to related buoyancy perturbations. These can result from density perturbations but also from the gravity perturbations. Whether the latter effect, which we call dynamic self-gravity (DSG), must be included or is negligible has been a matter of intense debate. We show that the second-order differential equation for the gravity perturbations becomes an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation when assuming a polytrope of index unity for density and pressure. This equation can be solved semi-analytically when using modiﬁed spherical Bessel functions for describing the radial dependence. The respective solutions allow us to quantify the impact of the DSG on each gravity harmonic, practically independent of the zonal ﬂow or the details of the planetary interior model. We ﬁnd that the impact decreases with growing spherical harmonic degree . For degrees = 2 to about = 4, the DSG is a ﬁrst-order effect and should be taken into account in any attempt of inverting gravity measurements for zonal ﬂow properties. For degrees of about = 5 to roughly = 10, the relative impact of DSG is about 10 per cent and thus seems worthwhile to include, in particular since this comes at little extra cost with the method presented here. For yet higher degrees, it seems questionable whether gravity measurements or interior models will ever reach the precision required for disentangling the small DSG effects, which amount to only a few per cent at best.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wicht","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Dietrich","given":"Wieland"},{"family":"Wulff","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Ulrich R"}],"citation-key":"WichtEtAl2020","container-title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","DOI":"10.1093/mnras/staa036","ISSN":"0035-8711, 1365-2966","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3364-3374","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Linking zonal winds and gravity: the relative importance of dynamic self-gravity","title-short":"Linking zonal winds and gravity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/492/3/3364/5706858","volume":"492"},

More heat would then simply be conducted down the core adiabat and would not be available for driving the dynamo process. The current status of this topic is reported and alternative driving scenarios are discussed. The paper then addresses the question whether dynamo simulations obey the magnetostrophic force balance that characterises the geodynamo and proceeds with discussing related problems like scaling laws and torsional oscillations.

  {"id":"WongEtAl2021","abstract":"Seismic observations of a slowdown in P wave velocity at the base of Earth's outer core suggest the presence of a stably-stratified region known as the F-layer. This raises an important question: how can light elements that drive the geodynamo pass through the stably-stratified layer without disturbing it? We consider the F-layer as a slurry containing solid particles dispersed within the liquid iron alloy that snow under gravity towards the inner core. We present a regime diagram showing how the dynamics of the slurry F-layer change upon varying the key parameters: Péclet number (Pe), the ratio between advection and chemical diffusion; Stefan number (St), the ratio between sensible and latent heat; and Lewis number (Le), the ratio between thermal and chemical diffusivity. We obtain four regimes corresponding to stable, partially stable, unstable and no slurries. No slurry is found when the heat flow at the base of the layer exceeds the heat flow at the top, while a stably-stratified slurry arises when advection overcomes thermal diffusion (Pe≳Le) that exists over a wide range of parameters relevant to the Earth's core. Our results estimate that a stably-stratified F-layer gives a maximum inner-core boundary (ICB) body wave density jump of Δρbod≤534kgm−3 which is compatible with the lower end of the seismic observations where 280≤Δρbod≤1,100kgm−3 is reported in the literature. With high thermal conductivity the model predicts an inner core age between 0.6 and 1.2Ga, which is consistent with other core evolution models. Our results suggest that a slurry model with high core conductivity predicts geophysical properties of the F-layer and core that are consistent with independent seismic and geodynamic calculations.","author":[{"family":"Wong","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Christopher A."}],"citation-key":"WongEtAl2021","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2021.116791","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"A regime diagram for the slurry F-layer at the base of Earth's outer core","type":"article-journal","volume":"560"},

  {"id":"Wu1997","abstract":"VLBI estimates for the retrograde annual nutation have shown that there is a 2 mas discrepancy with model results that assume a hydrostatically pre-stressed earth. This discrepancy has been used to infer that the non-hydrostatic Y-2(O) component of core-mantle-boundary (CMB) topography is roughly 0.5 km in amplitude. However, the possible effects of other topographic components have not been fully examined. Based on an earth model with a rigid mantle, a homogeneous and incompressible fluid core, and a slightly non-hydrostatic core-mantle boundary, we investigate effects of the core and of non-hydrostatic CMB topography on the Earth's nutations, Chandler wobble and tidal changes of the length of day (LOD). A convergent numerical technique is developed to solve the differential and boundary equations for both the free and forced motions. fn our solution, the fluid pressure is represented by a truncated sum of spherical harmonic functions in a special set of coordinates. We retain second-order CMB topographic factors with the equatorial core rotation in our nutation calculations. Using the degree variances of a recent seismically inferred CMB model (with nonhydrostatic CMB topography of about 3.5 km rms), the rms contribution of the randomly generated non-Y-2(O) topographic components to the retrograde annual nutation is about 0.55 mas. However, the effects of CMB topography depend on the reference earth model. A simple analysis shows that nutational effects for a realistic earth, with a non-rigid mantle and realistically stratified core, can be inferred by dividing our results by a factor of 2.61. The transformation then gives an rms effect of about 0.2 mas on the retrograde annual nutation. The effects depend on some CMB components more than they do on others. For example, results as large as 0.77 mas in the retrograde annual amplitude are possible for a realistic earth due to certain individual non-Y-2(O) CMB topographic components with mean-to-peak amplitudes of 4-5 km. The effects grow quadratically with topography, so that a 2 mas nutation amplitude would require those components to be 6-7 km in amplitude. The CMB topography is poorly known at present, but components of such magnitude may be unlikely. For the Chandler wobble and the tidal variations of LOD, the effects of CMB topography are likely to be small.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"X P"},{"family":"Wahr","given":"J M"}],"citation-key":"Wu1997","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","ISBN":"0956-540X","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"page":"18-42","title":"Effects of non-hydrostatic core-mantle boundary topography and core dynamics on Earth rotation","type":"article-journal","volume":"128"},

  {"id":"Wu2018","abstract":"The flow response of a rapidly rotating fluid-filled cube to low-amplitude librational forcing is investigated numerically. Librational forcing is the harmonic modulation of the mean rotation rate. The rotating cube supports inertial waves which may be excited by libration frequencies less than twice the rotation frequency. The response is comprised of two main components: resonant excitation of the inviscid inertial eigenmodes of the cube, and internal shear layers whose orientation is governed by the inviscid dispersion relation. The internal shear layers are driven by the fluxes in the forced boundary layers on walls orthogonal to the rotation axis and originate at the edges where these walls meet the walls parallel to the rotation axis, and are hence called edge beams. The relative contributions to the response from these components is obscured if the mean rotation period is not small enough compared to the viscous dissipation time, i.e. if the Ekman number is too large. We conduct simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations with no-slip boundary conditions using parameter values corresponding to a recent set of laboratory experiments, and reproduce the experimental observations and measurements. Then, we reduce the Ekman number by one and a half orders of magnitude, allowing for a better identification and quantification of the contributions to the response from the eigenmodes and the edge beams.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Welfert","given":"Bruno D."},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Juan M."}],"citation-key":"Wu2018","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","DOI":"10.1017/jfm.2018.157","ISSN":"14697645","issue":"May","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"469-494","title":"Librational forcing of a rapidly rotating fluid-filled cube","type":"article-journal","volume":"842"},

  {"id":"WunschFerrari2004","abstract":"▪ Abstract The coexistence in the deep ocean of a finite, stable stratification, a strong meridional overturning circulation, and mesoscale eddies raises complex questions concerning the circulation energetics. In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deep water tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Wunsch","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Raffaele"}],"citation-key":"WunschFerrari2004","container-title":"Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics","container-title-short":"Annu.

Using the methods developed here we are able to provide the first direct assessment of the importance of initial isostatic disequilibrium on the observed relative sea-level variations and free air gravity anomalies forced by the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet. We are therefore able to estimate the extent to which such initial disequilibrium might influence the inference of mantle viscosity from isostatic adjustment data.

  {"id":"XieVanneste2014","abstract":"Wind forcing of the ocean generates a spectrum of inertia-gravity waves that is sharply peaked near the local inertial (or Coriolis) frequency. The corresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are highly energetic and play a significant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse this role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between NIWs and balanced motion. The model is derived using the generalised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the glm variant of Soward & Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between the two types of motion to average over the short NIW period. We combine Salmon's (2013) variational formulation of GLM with Whitham averaging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution of NIWs and mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces this system to a simple model coupling Young & Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation for NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic equation. In this coupled model, the mean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction; conversely, the NIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the relation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity - through a quadratic wave term, consistent with the GLM results of Bu hler & McIntyre (1998). The coupled model is Hamiltonian and its conservation laws, for wave action and energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify a new interaction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from the balanced flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential advection and refraction so that their potential energy increases. A rough estimate suggests that this mechanism could provide a significant sink of energy for mesoscale motion and play a part in the global energetics of the ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Jin-Han"},{"family":"Vanneste","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"XieVanneste2014","genre":"Fluid Dynamics","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,13]]},"page":"25","title":"A generalised-Lagrangian-mean model of the interactions between near-inertial waves and mean flow","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3748"},

In a cylindrical volume of liquid gallium heated from below and cooled from above and subject to a vertical magnetic field, it is found that the large scale circulation (LSC) can undergo a slow axial precession. Our experiments demonstrate that this LSC precession occurs only when electrically conducting boundary conditions are employed, and that the precession direction reverses when the axial magnetic field direction is flipped. A thermoelectric magnetoconvection (TEMC) model is developed that successfully predicts the zeroth-order magnetoprecession dynamics. Our TEMC magnetoprecession model hinges on thermoelectric current loops at the top and bottom boundaries, which create Lorentz forces that generate horizontal torques on the overturning large-scale circulatory flow. The thermoelectric torques in our model act to drive a precessional motion of the LSC. This model yields precession frequency predictions that are in good agreement with the experimental observations. We postulate that thermoelectric effects in convective flows, long argued to be relevant in liquid metal heat transfer and mixing processes, may also have applications in planetary interior magnetohydrodynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Yufan"},{"family":"Horn","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Aurnou","given":"Jonathan M."}],"citation-key":"XuEtAl2022","container-title":"Journal of Fluid Mechanics","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"YangSong2023","abstract":"Differential rotation of Earth’s inner core relative to the mantle is thought to occur under the effects of the geodynamo on core dynamics and gravitational core–mantle coupling. This rotation has been inferred from temporal changes between repeated seismic waves that should traverse the same path through the inner core. Here we analyse repeated seismic waves from the early 1990s and show that all of the paths that previously showed significant temporal changes have exhibited little change over the past decade. This globally consistent pattern suggests that inner-core rotation has recently paused. We compared this recent pattern to the Alaskan seismic records of South Sandwich Islands doublets going back to 1964 and it seems to be associated with a gradual turning-back of the inner core as a part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation, with another turning point in the early 1970s. This multidecadal periodicity coincides with changes in several other geophysical observations, especially the length of day and magnetic field. These observations provide evidence for dynamic interactions between the Earth’s layers, from the deepest interior to the surface, potentially due to gravitational coupling and the exchange of angular momentum from the core and mantle to the surface. Multidecadal oscillation of the Earth’s inner core, coinciding with length of day and magnetic field variations, is experiencing a pause and reversing, according to analysis of repeating seismic waves traversing the inner core since the 1960s.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Song","given":"Xiaodong"}],"citation-key":"YangSong2023","container-title":"Nature Geoscience","container-title-short":"Nat.

In this paper, we have addressed the question whether there are other toroidal field surfaces allowing a standard PT representation than spheres and planes.

  {"id":"ZaqarashviliEtAl2007","abstract":"If there is one key element in the social psychology of behaviour that is still missing from Stern's ABC model, it is the role of habit. Stern (2000) acknowledges this and proposes that an integrated model of environmentally significant behaviour would consist of four factors: 1) attitudes; 2) contextual factors; 3) personal capabilities; and 4) habits. The general thrust of Stern's suggestion is very similar to an attempt made almost thirty years ago by social psychologist Harry Triandis to develop an integrated model of 'interpersonal' behaviour. Triandis recognised the key role played by both social factors and emotions in forming intentions. He also highlighted the importance of past behaviour on the present. On the basis of these observations, Triandis proposed a Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (Figure 4) in which intentions – as in many of the other models – are immediate antecedents of behaviour. But crucially, habits also mediate behaviour. And both these influences are moderated by facilitating conditions. Behaviour in any situation is, according to Triandis, a function partly of the intention, partly of the habitual responses, and partly of the situational constraints and conditions. The intention is influenced by social and affective factors as well as by rational deliberations. One is neither fully deliberative, in Triandis' model, nor fully automatic. One is neither fully autonomous nor entirely social. Behaviour is influenced by moral beliefs, but the impact of these is moderated both by emotional drives and cognitive limitations. Social factors include norms, roles and self-concept. Norms are the social rules about what should and should not be done. Roles are 'sets of behaviours that are considered appropriate for persons holding particular positions in a group' (Triandis, 1977). Self-concept refers to the idea that a person has of his/herself, the goals that it is appropriate for the person to pursue or to eschew, and the behaviours that the person does or does not engage in. Emotional responses to a decision or to a decision situation are assumed distinct from rational-instrumental evaluations of consequences, and may include both positive and negative emotional responses of varying strengths. Affect has a more or less unconscious input to decision-making, and is governed by instinctive behavioural responses to particular situations. Figure 3 Triandis' Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour Triandis offers an explicit role for affective factors on behavioural intentions. In more recent writings, the attempt to incorporate emotional antecedents into a model of action has received a lot of support (Bagozzi et al., 2002, Steg et al., 2001). Triandis theory of interpersonal behaviour captures many of the criticisms levelled at rational choice theory in a way that is not done by some of the other models. It also can be, and has been, used as a framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. It also can be, and has been, used as the framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. Far less use has been made of Triandis work than was made of the Ajzen-Fishbein work. However, where it has been used, it appears to have additional explanatory value over Ajzen's model, in particular, by including role beliefs and habits.

These waves (also known as planetary waves and r-modes) also play an important role in the large-scale dynamics of different astrophysical objects such as the solar atmosphere and interior, astrophysical discs, rapidly rotating stars, planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. This paper provides a review of theoretical and observational aspects of Rossby waves on different spatial and temporal scales in various astrophysical settings. The physical role played by Rossby-type waves and associated instabilities is discussed in the context of solar and stellar magnetic activity, angular momentum transport in astrophysical discs, planet formation, and other astrophysical processes.

  {"id":"ZengJansen2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Previous studies that have considered the ocean circulation on Enceladus have generally assumed the salinity to be Earth-like. However, according to observations and geochemical constraints, the salinity of Enceladus’s ocean is likely to be lower, and importantly, it is probably low enough to reverse the sign of thermal expansivity. We investigate the ocean circulation and stratification of Enceladus’s ocean using a combination of theoretical arguments and simulations using the MITgcm. We find that if the salinity is high, the whole ocean is unstratified, and convection dominates the entire ocean. However, if the salinity is low enough, there exists a stratified layer in the upper ocean, whose thickness depends on the magnitude of the turbulent vertical diffusivity, which remains poorly constrained. Such a layer can suppress the vertical flux of heat and tracers, thereby affecting the heat flux to the ice shell and leading to a vertical tracer mixing timescale across the stratified layer of at least hundreds of years. This timescale is inconsistent with a previous estimate of vertical ocean mixing of several years, based on the size of detected silica nanoparticles in the plumes, leading us to conclude that either the salinity of Enceladus’s ocean is higher than previously suggested or the interpretation of silica nanoparticle observations has to be reconsidered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"Yaoxuan"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Malte F."}],"citation-key":"ZengJansen2021","container-title":"The Planetary Science Journal","container-title-short":"Planet.

It is shown that the combined effects of Coriolis forces and spherical curvature enable the equatorial region to form an equatorial waveguide tube with characteristic latitudinal radius (2/m) and radial radius (1/m), where m is azimuthal wavenumber. Inertial waves with sufficiently simple structure along the axis of rotation and sufficiently small azimuthal wavelength must be trapped in the equatorial waveguide tube. The structure and frequency of the inertial waves are thus hardly affected by the presence of an inner sphere or by the condition of higher latitudes.

Explicit general analytical expressions for solutions of the problem are found in a rotating sphere for the first time.

Appling the new estimated PIMs to the triaxial three-layered Earth rotation theory with considering various couplings, the numerical calculations show that the periods of the Chandler Wobble (CW), Free Core Nutation (FCN), Free Inner Core Nutation (FICN) and Inner Core Wobble (ICW) are respectively 433.0, 430.8, 943.9 and 2735.9 mean solar days, which are well comparable with the corresponding values accepted at present in geoscience community.

  {"id":"ZhangDumberry2021","abstract":"The spin axes of the mantle, ﬂuid core and solid inner core of the Moon precess at frequency Ωp = 2π/18.6 yr−1 though with diﬀerent orientations, leading to viscous friction at the coremantle boundary (CMB) and inner core boundary (ICB). Here, we use a rotational model of the Moon with a range of inner core and outer core radii to investigate the relative importance of viscous dissipation at the CMB and ICB, and to show how this dissipation is connected to the phase lead angle (φp) of the mantle ahead of its Cassini state. We show that when the inner core radius is > 80 km and the free inner core nutation frequency Ωficn approaches Ωp, viscous dissipation at the ICB can be comparable to that at the CMB, and in the most extreme cases exceed it by as much as a factor 10. If so, the viscous dissipation in the lunar core projected back in time depends on how Ωficn has evolved relative to Ωp. We further show that constraints on the CMB and ICB radii of the lunar core can in principle be extracted by matching the observed phase lead of φp = 0.27 arcsec; this requires an improved estimate of tidal dissipation and an accurate model of the turbulent viscous torque. Lastly, when our rotational model is constrained to match φp = 0.27 arcsec, our results suggest that the viscous dissipation at the ICB is likely insuﬃcient to have ever been above the threshold to power a thermally driven dynamo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiarui"},{"family":"Dumberry","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"ZhangDumberry2021","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets","container-title-short":"J Geophys Res Planets","DOI":"10.1029/2021JE006966","ISSN":"2169-9097, 2169-9100","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Viscous dissipation in the fluid core of the Moon","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00781","volume":"126"},

  {"id":"ZhangFearn1995","abstract":"This paper presents the first attempt to examine the stability of a poloidal magnetic field in a rapidly rotating spherical shell of electrically conducting fluid. We find that a steady axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field loses its stability to a non-axisymmetric perturbation when the Elsasser number A based on the maximum strength of the field exceeds a value about 20. Comparing this with observed fields, we find that, for any reasonable estimates of the appropriate parameters in planetary interiors, our theory predicts that all planetary poloidal fields are stable, with the possible exception of Jupiter. The present study therefore provides strong support for the physical relevance of magnetic stability analysis to planetary dynamos. We find that the fluid motions driven by magnetic instabilities are characterized by a nearly two-dimensional columnar structure attempting to satisfy the Proudman-Taylor theorm. This suggests that the most rapidly growing perturbation arranges itself in such a way that the geostrophic condition is satisfied to leading order. A particularly interesting feature is that, for the most unstable mode, contours of the non-axisymmetric azimuthal flow are closely aligned with the basic axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field lines. As a result, the amplitude of the azimuthal component of the instability is smaller than or comparable with that of the poloidal component, in contrast with the instabilities generated by toroidal decay modes (Zhang and Fearn, 1994).It is shown, by examining the same system with and without fluid inertia, that fluid inertia plays a secondary role when the magnetic Taylor number T , 2 lo5. We find that the direction of propagation of hydromagnetic waves driven by the instability is influenced strongly by the size of the inner core.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"K."},{"family":"Fearn","given":"D.

  {"id":"ZhangShen2021","abstract":"We propose a parametric approach to the topographic (TOP) coupling between the mantle and outer core for refinement of the latest triaxial three-layered Earth rotation theory. Based on three models of the core–mantle boundary (CMB) topography, we obtain the axial components of the TOP torque as −2.08 × 1019, −2.72 × 1018 and −1.97 × 1017 N m, respectively. Under the frame of the triaxial three-layered Earth rotation theory, we solve the corresponding periods of free core nutation as −(329.83 ± 28.12), −(457.54 ± ∼) and −(428.23 ± 1.09) mean solar days (d), respectively. The other three normal modes, namely, Chandler wobble, inner core wobble and free inner core nutation, are almost not affected by the TOP coupling of the CMB, their period values being 433.24, 2718.69 and 934.02 d, respectively. Calculations show that the TOP torque is highly sensitive to the adopted model of the topography, which is known to be robust. Taking into account the normal modes of the triaxial three-layered Earth rotation, the results of the CMB topography obtained by seismic tomography can be constrained in the future to a certain extent. In this study, considering the TOP coupling with the appropriate topography model, the estimates for the dynamic ellipticity ef of the fluid core lie between 0.0026340 and 0.0026430, values that are 3.56 % higher than the hydrostatic equilibrium value.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Huifeng"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Wenbin"}],"citation-key":"ZhangShen2021","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggab079","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,25]]},"page":"2060-2074","publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"Core–mantle topographic coupling: a parametric approach and implications for the formulation of a triaxial three-layered Earth rotation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/225/3/2060/6155065","volume":"225"},
  {"id":"ZhuEtAl2017","abstract":"The global Very Long Baseline Interferometry observation for measuring the Earth rotation's parameters was launched around 1970s. Since then the precision of the measurements is continuously improving by taking into account various instrumental and environmental effects. The MHB2000 nutation model was introduced in 2002, which is constructed based on a revised nutation series derived from 20 years VLBI observations (1980–1999). In this work, we firstly estimated the amplitudes of all nutation terms from the IERS-EOP-C04 VLBI global solutions w.r.t. IAU1980, then we further inferred the BEPs (Basic Earth's Parameters) by fitting the major nutation terms. Meanwhile, the BEPs were obtained from the same nutation time series using a BI (Bayesian Inversion). The corrections to the precession rate and the estimated BEPs are in an agreement, independent of which methods have been applied.","author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Rivoldini","given":"Attilio"},{"family":"Koot","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Dehant","given":"Véronique"}],"citation-key":"ZhuEtAl2017","container-title":"Geodesy and Geodynamics","DOI":"10.1016/j.geog.2017.04.007","ISSN":"16749847","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"427-432","title":"Basic Earth's Parameters as estimated from VLBI observations","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},
