I want to talk some more about the concept of *contradiction*.

- Critique by Karl Popper
- How the difficulty that he mentions has been resolved formally by dialetheism
- How one of Popper's most celebrated stance was also a paradox (on the necessity to silence those that would want to silence you)
- The political nature of the debate.
- Einstein said: $E=mc^2$
