The Earth has a liquid layer beneath its rocky mantle. This liquid core spans about half of the Earth's radius (~3,486 km) and is primarily composed of molten iron. Electric currents within the conducting iron generate the geomagnetic field that we observe at the Earth's surface.

The motion of the fluid core also influences the Earth's rotation in several ways. It amplifies the Earth's response to the gravitational torque exerted by the Sun and Moon, known as nutations. It also causes small variations in the length of the day through a series of complex processes involving the exchange of angular momentum at the Core-Mantle Boundary [@RekierEtAl2021].

In this project, we focus on the hydrodynamics and hydromagnetic *waves* excited within the fluid core, governed by the complex interplay of the rotation, buoyancy, and the magnetic field [@TrianaEtAl2021]. A particular emphasis is put on *inertial* waves, whose motion is dictated by the action of the Coriolis force.
