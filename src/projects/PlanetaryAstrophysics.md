Many of the fluid dynamics phenomena that take place inside the Earth's core also manifest in the fluid layers of other astrophysical objects such as planets, moons, and stars. [Rossby modes](/blog/2022/rossby-modes) (a special type of inertial modes) have been observed in the convective envelope of the Sun [@LoptienEtAl2018], heralding a new era in Astroseismology (the deep probing of stars through the study of their oscillations). More oscillations of this type were later observed [@HansonEtAl2022] and later confirmed as inertial modes by our team [@TrianaEtAl2022].
