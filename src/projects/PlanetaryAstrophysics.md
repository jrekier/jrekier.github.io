Many of the fluid dynamics phenomena that take place inside the Earth's core also manifest in the fluid layers of other astrophysical objects such as planets, moons, and stars. Rossby modes (a special type of inertial modes) have been observed in the convective envelope of the Sun [@LoptienEtAl2018], heralding a new era in Astroseismology (the deep probing of stars through the study of their oscillations). More oscillations of this type were later observed [@HansonEtAl2022] and later confirmed as inertial modes by our team [@TrianaEtAl2022].
