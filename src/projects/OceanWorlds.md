Past space missions have confirmed the existence of liquid water beneath the surfaces of Jupiter's and Saturn's icy moons. The source of energy that sustains this liquid water remains a mystery. The most probable explanation is dissipative tides raised by the parent planet, which heat the moons through friction. However, the exact mechanism by which this tidal energy is converted into heat is not yet fully understood.

Here, we focus on the resonant amplification of tides through the excitation of modes in the liquid oceans.

Our team showed that *inertial modes* excited by tides and libration can amplify the viscous dissipation in Saturn's moon Enceladus's ocean [@Rekier2019].
